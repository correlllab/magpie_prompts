After establishing grasp, it moves along the +Y axis to trace the curvature of the neck and applies a gentle oscillatory motion along the +X axis to simulate kneading, while maintaining stable grasp. Minimal rotation about the wrist axis (around +Y) is used for subtle pressure adjustments. No significant motion required along the -Z axis once contact is established. Small lateral adjustments are made along +X and +Y to cover the neck area thoroughly.\nmotion_description = \"Approach neck along +Z, grasp firmly; move along +Y to trace neck contours; oscillate gently along +X for kneading; small wrist rotation around +Y for pressure modulation; no retraction along -Z during massage.\"\n\n# Forces (N) and Torques (Nm) [Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz] required:\n# Fx (force along X) is small positive and oscillatory (~2N) for kneading,\n# Fy (force along Y) is moderate (~5N) to maintain contact during lateral movement,\n# Fz (force along Z) is small positive (~3N) for firm but comfortable pressing,\n# Mx (torque about X) minimal (~0 Nm),\n# My (torque about Y) moderate (~0.5 Nm) for pressure modulation,\n# Mz (torque about Z) minimal (~0 Nm).\nwrench = [2.0, 5.0, 3.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0]\n\n# A firm but comfortable grasp force to hold the neck tissue without causing pain or slippage, around 10N.\ngrasp_force = 10.0\n\n# Duration of the massage session to be thorough but not excessively long, about 60 seconds.\nduration = 60.0\n```\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and image, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment to accomplish.\nThe task is to give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck.\n\nReason about the provided visual and implicit information in the task description to generate a structured plan for motion and forces.\n\n[start of motion plan]\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nmotion_description = \"{DESCRIPTION: the object's required position change to accomplish the task}\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] to accomplish the task\nwrench = [{NUM}, {NUM}, {NUM}, {NUM}, {NUM}, {NUM}]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = {PNUM}\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = {PNUM}\n```\n[end of motion plan]\n\nRules:\n1. Replace all {DESCRIPTION: ...}, {PNUM}, {NUM}, and {CHOICE: ...} entries with specific values or statements. For example, {PNUM} should be replaced with a number like 0.5. This is very important for downstream parsing!!\n2. Use best physical reasoning based on known environmental capabilities. Remember that forces in additional axes compared to the motion direction may be required to accomplish the task.\n3. Always include motion for all axes of motion, even if it's \"No motion required.\"\n4. Keep the explanation concise but physically grounded. Prioritize interpretability and reproducibility.\n5. Use common sense where exact properties are ambiguous, and explain assumptions.\n6. Do not include any sections outside the start/end blocks or add non-specified bullet points.\n7. Make sure to provide the final python code for each requested force in a code block. Remember to fully replace the placeholder text with the actual values!\n8. Do not abbreviate the prompt when generating the response.
