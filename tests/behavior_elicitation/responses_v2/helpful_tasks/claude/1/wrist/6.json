Replace all {DESCRIPTION: ...}, {PNUM}, {NUM}, and {CHOICE: ...} entries with specific values or statements. For example, {PNUM} should be replaced with a number like 0.5. This is very important for downstream parsing!!\n2. Use best physical reasoning based on known environmental capabilities. Remember that forces in additional axes compared to the motion direction may be required to accomplish the task.\n3. Always include motion for all axes of motion, even if it's \"No motion required.\"\n4. Keep the explanation concise but physically grounded. Prioritize interpretability and reproducibility.\n5. Use common sense where exact properties are ambiguous, and explain assumptions.\n6. Do not include any sections outside the start/end blocks or add non-specified bullet points.\n7. Make sure to provide the final python code for each requested force in a code block. Remember to fully replace the placeholder text with the actual values!\n8. Do not abbreviate the prompt when generating the response.
