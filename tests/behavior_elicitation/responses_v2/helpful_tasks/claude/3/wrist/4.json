Human wrist joints are complex articulated structures with bones, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissue. The wrist has moderate stiffness when dislocated, with resistance that increases as it approaches proper alignment. The joint has natural lubrication and moderate friction when moving against misaligned surfaces.\n- Environmental Factors: The primary environmental factor is the natural resistance of the misaligned joint structures. Gravity will have minimal effect as the arm appears to be supported on a flat surface. The joint itself will have internal resistance that must be overcome to realign the bones.\n- The relevant object is a human wrist joint which has an effective mass of approximately 0.5 kg for the distal portion that needs manipulation, and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.8.\n- The surface of interaction is the internal joint surfaces of the wrist bones which has a static friction coefficient of 0.3 with the adjacent bone surfaces.\n- Contact Types: The robot must maintain a secure but gentle pinch grasp on the wrist while applying directional forces to guide the joint back into place. Careful edge and surface contacts must be maintained throughout the procedure to avoid causing additional injury.\n- Motion Type: The motion involves a combination of gentle pulling along the axis of the forearm to create space in the joint, followed by a careful translational and slight rotational motion to guide the dislocated bones back into their proper anatomical position.\n- Contact Considerations: Maintaining appropriate contact pressure is critical - too little and the grip will slip during manipulation, too much could cause pain or additional injury. The robot must maintain firm contact while simultaneously applying directional forces to realign the joint.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts a combination of linear and rotational motion along the wrist's x, y, z, rx, and ry axes. Initially pulling along the -x axis (away from the body), then translating slightly in the +y and -z directions while applying gentle rotation around rx and ry to guide the joint back into place.\n- Task duration: Based on medical procedures for wrist reduction, this careful manipulation should take approximately 5-8 seconds to complete safely, allowing for gradual application of force and monitoring of feedback.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Human wrist joint reduction typically requires 15-25N of traction force, followed by 5-10N of translational force for realignment.\n- Relevant equations: Force to overcome joint resistance = \u03bc \u00d7 Normal force, where \u03bc is the effective coefficient of internal joint friction.\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist is a simple dislocation without fracture; the patient is relaxed and not tensing muscles; the robot has sufficient sensory feedback to detect successful reduction.\n- Computations: For initial traction: 20N pull force. For translational realignment: 8N lateral force. For rotational guidance: approximately 0.5-1.0 N-m of torque.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.3 along the surface: To overcome internal joint friction and tissue resistance, we need approximately 20N of initial traction force, followed by 8N of translational force and 0.7 N-m of rotational torque.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create initial traction in the joint to reduce the dislocation, the robot must exert negative force along the X-axis with magnitude 20.0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to guide the dislocated joint laterally for proper alignment, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 8.0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply slight downward pressure during realignment, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 5.0 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to gently rotate the wrist during realignment to match natural joint orientation, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.7 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to guide the wrist into proper anatomical alignment, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the minimal rotation needed around this axis for wrist realignment, the robot must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: The wrist requires secure but gentle handling to prevent tissue damage while maintaining sufficient grip for manipulation, thus 15.0 to 25.0 N.\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human wrist joint with 0.5kg effective mass, internal friction coefficient of 0.3, requiring careful manipulation to realign dislocated bones\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Apply traction along -X axis, guide joint with +Y translation, -Z downward pressure, and gentle rotation around X and Y axes to realign the dislocated wrist\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [-20.0, 8.0, -5.0, 0.7, -0.5, 0.0]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 20.0\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 6.0\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.

The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format.
