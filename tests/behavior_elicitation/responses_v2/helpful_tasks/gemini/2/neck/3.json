The neck appears relatively soft and pliable. The location of the neck is crucial for proper grasp and motion planning.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the coordinate frame is positioned at the wrist, which is rigidly attached to the gripper. The axes are oriented with Z pointing roughly upwards and slightly into the image, X pointing roughly to the right of the image, and Y pointing roughly upwards and slightly to the right of the image.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion upwards and slightly into the image in the world.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move up and down gently to simulate a massage action.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right in the image in the world.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move left and right gently to simulate a massage action.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion upwards and slightly to the right of the image in the world.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move up and down gently to simulate a massage action.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved cyclically in the X, Y, and Z axes to provide a massage, while the robot maintains a grasp on the neck with appropriate grasping force.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 0.5 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0.5 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert linear negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 1.0 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force:  The force needed to grip the neck without slippage or excessive pressure, considering the soft tissue. A light grip is desired. Estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 1.0 to 3.0 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The object is a human neck, with an estimated mass around 3-5 kg and a soft, pliable tissue composition.

The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\n\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format.
