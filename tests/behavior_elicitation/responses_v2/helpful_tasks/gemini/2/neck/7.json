The man appears to be in a seated position, and his neck is accessible for grasping and massage. The material of his neck is skin.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the red axis points to the right of the man, the green axis points towards the back of his head, and the blue axis points upwards towards his head.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to vertical motion relative to the man's head, with positive Z moving upwards.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move with small oscillations up and down to provide a massage motion.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to the motion of the robot's wrist from the man's left to his right.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move with small oscillations left and right to provide a massage motion.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to the motion from the front to the back of the man's neck.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move with small oscillations forward and backward to provide a massage motion.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with small oscillations in the x, y and z axes to provide a thorough massage while maintaining a firm but gentle grasp.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 0.5 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0.0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert linear negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 1.0 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force:  The man's neck is relatively soft and delicate, and the grasp must be firm enough to maintain contact but not too forceful to cause discomfort.
