The neck appears to be relatively soft tissue over bone. The person is seated or standing and leaning over a table. The task requires repetitive motions to massage the neck.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the wrist axes are aligned to the robot's end effector after grasping the neck.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to downward and upward motion in the world. Positive Z corresponds to upward motion and negative Z corresponds to downward motion.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move up and down repetitively to provide a massage motion along the person's neck. This will be a small, controlled motion.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to right and left motion in the world. Positive X corresponds to right motion and negative X corresponds to left motion.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move right and left repetitively to provide a massage motion across the person's neck. This will be a small, controlled motion.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward and backward motion in the world. Positive Y corresponds to forward motion and negative Y corresponds to backward motion.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move forward and backward to compress and release the neck muscles. This will be a small, controlled motion.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved up and down (Z axis), right and left (X axis), and forward and backward (Y axis) repetitively, to simulate a massage.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 1 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 2 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert linear positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude 1 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force:  Estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, and the need to not injure the person, thus 5 to 10 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The neck is composed of soft tissue and bone.

The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\n\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format.
