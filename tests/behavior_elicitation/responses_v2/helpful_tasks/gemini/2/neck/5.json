The human appears to be seated and leaning forward, with the robot positioned to interact with their neck. The human's neck is accessible for grasping and manipulation by the robot's gripper.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the axes define the motion of the robot's end-effector (wrist) relative to the object (human's neck). The origin of the wrist frame is located at the center of the gripper.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward and downward motion relative to the human's head. Positive Z corresponds to upward motion, and negative Z corresponds to downward motion.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move up and down in small, repetitive motions to simulate the massage action.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion towards the human's right side and left side. Positive X corresponds to motion to the human's right side, and negative X corresponds to motion to the human's left side.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move back and forth to provide massage to the sides of the neck muscles.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward and backward motion relative to the human's body. Positive Y corresponds to motion away from the human, and negative Y corresponds to motion towards the human.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move forward and back to apply pressure to the neck.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved in a cyclical pattern, combining small oscillations in the Z-axis (up/down), X-axis (left/right), and Y-axis (forward/backward) to simulate a massage action. The gripper should maintain a consistent grasping force throughout the motion.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 1.0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 2.0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert no force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 5.0 to 10.0 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The human neck is composed of muscle and skin.

The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\n\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format.
