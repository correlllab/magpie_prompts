Maintaining a firm grasp is crucial.}.\n- Motion Type: {DESCRIPTION: Combination of linear and rotational motion. Primarily a pushing motion along the X-axis while simultaneously applying a slight rotational correction about the Z-axis to relocate the wrist.}.\n- Contact Considerations: {DESCRIPTION: Constant grasping force is needed.
