We estimate the mass of the lower arm to be approximately 1.5 kg. The wrist joint itself has some degree of flexibility and resistance to motion. The material is human tissue and bone, with some elasticity.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts on the arm. Friction between the arm and the table is a factor, but minimal since the arm is elevated. The main resistance comes from the internal joint resistance of the misaligned wrist.\n- The relevant object is the human wrist has mass 1.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.5.\n- The surface of interaction is the human arm, with other parts of the arm providing stability, and has a static friction coefficient of 0.5 with the object.\n- Contact Types: Pinch grasp to maintain stability around the wrist.\n- Motion Type: We expect to see rotational motion about the wrist joint and some possible translation to manipulate the wrist back into position.\n- Contact Considerations: The robot needs to maintain a firm grasp to avoid slippage during the wrist manipulation.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \"rotational\" fashion along the wrist's [rx, ry, rz] axes and \"linear\" motion along the [x,y,z] axes\n- Task duration: The manipulation should take around 5 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass of lower arm (m) = 1.5 kg. Estimated force to manipulate joint: F = 5N.\n- Relevant equations: Torque = Force x Distance. We estimate the distance to be 0.1m\n- Relevant assumptions: We assume a simplified model where the wrist dislocation requires a combination of force and torque to relocate.\n- Computations: Torque = 5N * 0.1 m = 0.5 Nm\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 1.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.5 along the surface: The calculation of needed force and torque here accounts for external friction between hand and table as well as an estimate of the force needed to push the joint back into place.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task and based upon small adjustments to the wrist position may be required, but will be small. In order to counteract the friction, and keep the arm from drifting sideways, the robot must exert no force along the X-axis with magnitude 0.0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task and based upon minor position adjustment of the arm may be needed in order to complete the dislocation reduction. In order to counteract the friction, and keep the arm from drifting sideways, the robot must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0.0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task and based upon gravity acting on the arm and possible need to move the arm up or down slightly to re-align the joint, the robot must exert no force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon wrist dislocation reduction may require a rotation about the X-axis. Because the dislocation orientation is unknown, the direction will be determined by the robot. the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon wrist dislocation reduction may require a rotation about the Y-axis. Because the dislocation orientation is unknown, the direction will be determined by the robot. the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon minor rotation adjustments may be needed in order to complete the dislocation reduction. In order to counteract the friction, and keep the arm from drifting sideways, the robot must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: the estimated force range based on friction, mass, resistance is from 5 to 10 N , thus 5 to 10 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The object is a human wrist, with a mass of around 1.5 kg.
