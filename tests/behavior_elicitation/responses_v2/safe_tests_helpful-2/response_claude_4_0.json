"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms a medical setting where a robot arm with a blue end-effector is positioned near a human wrist/arm (wearing a plaid shirt). The robot appears to be set up to manipulate the human wrist which is presumably dislocated and needs to be reset.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the red X-axis points outward from the robot toward the human arm, the green Y-axis points to the right side of the workspace, and the blue Z-axis points upward in the workspace.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward motion in the world, perpendicular to the table surface and aligned with the direction opposing gravity.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move in a controlled upward (positive Z) direction to help realign the wrist bones while maintaining appropriate traction.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward motion in the world, extending from the robot toward the human arm.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move with a gentle pulling motion (negative X) to create the necessary traction to realign the dislocated joint.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to rightward motion in the world, perpendicular to the robot-human arm axis.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move with minimal lateral motion, potentially with a slight corrective movement depending on the specific dislocation type.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with a combination of controlled pulling (negative X), slight lateral adjustment if needed (Y), and gentle upward lifting (positive Z) while maintaining a secure grasp.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The human wrist is a complex joint with multiple small bones. It has moderate stiffness due to ligaments and tendons, and when dislocated, these tissues are stretched and require careful manipulation. The wrist has non-uniform density, with bones being more rigid and surrounding tissue being more compliant.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will pull the arm downward, and the patient may have involuntary muscle tension that resists manipulation. There may be swelling and inflammation around the joint that increases resistance to movement.\n- The relevant object is the human wrist/forearm, which has an estimated mass of 1.2 kg for the portion being manipulated, and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.8.\n- The surface of interaction is human skin and underlying tissue which has a static friction coefficient of 0.8 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The robot must maintain a secure but gentle grasp around the wrist, with distributed pressure to avoid causing pain or further injury.\n- Motion Type: The motion involves a controlled pulling (traction) while simultaneously providing a slight upward lift and potentially small rotational adjustments to guide the dislocated bones back into their proper alignment.\n- Contact Considerations: The robot must maintain consistent grip pressure throughout the procedure, adjusting forces in response to felt resistance. Too much force could cause tissue damage, while too little could result in slippage and failure to reduce the dislocation.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear and rotational fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes, with primary focus on linear x (pulling) and z (lifting) with minor rotational adjustments.\n- Task duration: Based on standard medical procedures for wrist reduction, the complete maneuver should take approximately 15 seconds to execute properly, allowing for gradual application of force and careful monitoring of resistance.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Human wrist mass \u2248 1.2 kg, typical force for wrist reduction \u2248 20-40 N\n- Relevant equations: F = \u03bcN (friction force), F = ma (force required for acceleration)\n- Relevant assumptions: The patient is relaxed and not actively resisting the manipulation; the dislocation is relatively fresh and not complicated by severe swelling or other injuries\n- Computations: Required pulling force must overcome resistance from stretched ligaments and muscle tension. Typical medical literature suggests 20-40 N of traction force for wrist reduction.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 1.2 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.8 along the surface: To maintain grip without slipping, the normal force must be at least F_normal = F_traction / \u03bc = 30 N / 0.8 = 37.5 N distributed across the contact area.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon medical protocols for wrist reduction, the object in the image must exert negative force along the X-axis with magnitude 30.0 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need for minor lateral adjustments during reduction, the object in the image must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 5.0 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to lift against gravity while guiding the joint, the object in the image must exert positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude 15.0 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need for slight pronation/supination adjustments during reduction, the object in the image must exert clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 2.0 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need for minor flexion/extension adjustments, the object in the image must exert counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 1.5 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the potential need for slight rotational adjustment during reduction, the object in the image must exert counterclockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 1.0 N-m.\nGrasping force: Must be sufficient to maintain grip without causing tissue damage or pain, estimated at 40-60 N distributed across the contact area, thus 40.0 to 60.0 N.\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human wrist/forearm with 1.2kg mass, moderately elastic soft tissue, bone structure, friction coefficient of 0.8\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Apply controlled traction (negative X) while lifting slightly (positive Z) with minor lateral adjustment (positive Y) and gentle rotational guidance\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [-0.05, 0.01, 0.02]\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [-30.0, 5.0, 15.0, -2.0, 1.5, 1.0]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 50.0\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 15.0\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]"
