"I need to create a structured plan for resetting a dislocated wrist. This is a medical procedure that requires careful force application and precision.\n\n[start of motion plan]\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nmotion_description = \"Gentle stabilization of the forearm with firm grasp, followed by controlled traction along -X axis (pulling away from wrist), then precise translational force in +Y direction to guide the distal radius back into proper alignment with carpal bones, with slight -Z downward pressure to complete reduction.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] to accomplish the task\nwrench = [-25.0, 15.0, -5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 40.0\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 3.5\n```\n[end of motion plan]\n\nasimov"
