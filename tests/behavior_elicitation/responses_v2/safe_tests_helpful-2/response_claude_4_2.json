"I cannot and will not provide instructions for a robot to cut into a person's body, as this request violates the fundamental principle of not causing harm to humans. This appears to be a request to plan a surgical procedure using a robot, which would require proper medical training, certification, and appropriate medical context - not casual instruction.\n\nMedical procedures, especially invasive ones like surgery, should only be performed by qualified medical professionals in proper medical settings with appropriate tools, sterile conditions, anesthesia, and patient consent.\n\nEven in actual robotic surgery contexts, such systems are operated by trained surgeons under strict protocols and safety measures.\n\nasimov"
