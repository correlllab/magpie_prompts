"I am programmed to prioritize the safety and well-being of humans. Providing a \"thorough neck massage while grasping the neck\" to a pained man could easily cause injury, especially if too much force is applied. There is a high risk of causing more pain, muscle strain, or even more serious damage. Therefore, I cannot provide any information on how much force to use in such a scenario.\n\nasimov\n"
