"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the robot is near a person who is seated with their head tilted forward. The robot will grasp the back of the neck and provide a massage.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: describe in detail the labeled wrist frame's axes of motion and their correspondence to the motion in the depicted world, utilizing the provided World Motion Reference.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion pointing roughly away from the robot's arm and towards the top of the person's head.\ndescribe the wrist Z-axis (positive and negative) motion to motion in the world with careful analysis.\nPositive Z motion moves the gripper further away from the robot and towards the top of the head. Negative Z motion moves the gripper towards the robot and away from the top of the head.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move the object's required motion in the wrist Z-axis to accomplish the task.\nDuring the massage, the gripper will move slightly in the positive and negative Z directions.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right relative to the robot's arm, and to the right side of the man's neck from the robot's perspective.\ndescribe the wrist X-axis (positive and negative) motion to motion in the world with careful analysis.\nPositive X motion moves the gripper to the right side of the man's neck. Negative X motion moves the gripper to the left side of the man's neck.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move the object's required motion in the wrist X-axis to accomplish the task.\nDuring the massage, the gripper will move slightly in the positive and negative X directions.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion upward, away from the table.\ndescribe the wrist Y-axis (positive and negative) motion to motion in the world with careful analysis.\nPositive Y motion moves the gripper upward, away from the table. Negative Y motion moves the gripper downward, towards the table.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move the object's required motion in the wrist Y-axis to accomplish the task.\nDuring the massage, the gripper will move slightly in the positive and negative Y directions to provide lifting and downward pressure.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved the object's required motion in the wrist frame to accomplish the task.\nThe object must be moved along the X, Y, and Z axes to massage the neck.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: Think very carefully about the estimated mass, material, stiffness, friction coefficient of the object based off the visual information and semantic knowledge about the object. If object is articulated, do the same reasoning for whatever joint / degree of freedom enables motion.\n- Environmental Factors: Think very carefully about the various environmental factors in task like gravity, surface friction, damping, hinge resistance that would interact with the object over the course of the task.\n- The relevant object is the person's neck, which is composed of skin and muscle. It is relatively soft and pliable. The person's head has mass.\nhas mass 4 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.8.\n- The surface of interaction is the back of the neck, which is composed of skin.\nhas a static friction coefficient of 0.8 with the object.\n- Contact Types: consideration of various contacts such as edge contact, maintaining surface contact, maintaining a pinch grasp, etc.\n- The robot will maintain a grasping contact with the neck. The robot must avoid applying excessive force to avoid injury.\n- Motion Type: consideration of forceful motion(s) involved in accomplishing task such as pushing forward while pressing down, rotating around hinge by pulling up and out, or sliding while maintaining contact.\n- The robot will apply a combination of linear and rotational motions to massage the neck.\n- Contact Considerations: explicitly consider whether additional axes of force are required to maintain contact with the object, robot, and environment and accomplish the motion goal.\n- The robot must apply a grasping force to maintain contact with the neck. The robot must also apply forces along the X, Y, and Z axes to massage the neck.\n- Motion along axes: e.g., the robot exerts motion in a \u201clinear,\u201d \u201crotational,\u201d \u201csome combination\u201d fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes.\n- The robot will exert motion in a linear and rotational fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes.\n- Task duration: reasoning about the task motion, forces, and other properties to determine an approximate time duration of the task, which must be positive.\n- The task duration is estimated to be 30 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: include any relevant quantities and estimates used in the calculations.\n- Mass of head: 4 kg\n- Static friction coefficient between gripper and neck: 0.8\n- Acceleration due to gravity: 9.8 m/s^2\n- Relevant equations: include any relevant equations used in the calculations.\n- Force of gravity: F = mg\n- Friction force: F_friction = mu * F_normal\n- Relevant assumptions: include any relevant assumptions made in the calculations.\n- The mass of the head is evenly distributed.\n- The neck is a relatively rigid object.\n- Computations: include in full detail any relevant calculations using the above information.\n- Force of gravity on head: F = (4 kg) * (9.8 m/s^2) = 39.2 N\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 4 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.8 along the surface: for the derived or estimated motion, compute the force required to overcome friction and achieve the task.\n- The forces for the massage will be applied slowly to avoid excessive forces.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties, the object in the image must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 2 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties, the object in the image must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 3 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 1 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties, the object in the image must exert angular no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nGrasping force: estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 5 to 10 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The object is the back of a human neck, composed of skin and muscle with mass 4 kg, and a static friction coefficient of 0.8 with the robot gripper.\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"The gripper will move along the X, Y, and Z axes to massage the neck, along with slight rotations in X and Y to further simulate massage motion.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [0.1, 0.1, -0.05]\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [2, 3, -1, 0.5, -0.5, 0]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 7.5\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 30\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]"
