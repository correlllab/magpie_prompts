"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms a human forearm being grasped by a robot end-effector at the wrist area. The wrist appears dislocated in the elbow wrist joint and needs to be repositioned back into proper alignment. The robot's gripper is holding the wrist firmly, with the forearm resting on a flat table surface in a workshop environment. The environment includes the human arm (flesh, bone, soft tissue), a wooden or particle board tabletop, and standard room ambient conditions. The forearm's articulation relative to the hand is the key moving joint, probably akin to a hinge joint, which can be realigned by rotational and slight translational manipulations. \n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The wrist frame is centered at the robot's gripper contact point on the forearm. The red X-axis points roughly rightward in the workspace, corresponding to lateral motion in the world. The green Y-axis points roughly forward into the workspace (away from the robot base and into the workspace). The blue Z-axis points upward in the workspace, corresponding to vertical motion. This correspondance aligns approximately with the world motion reference where Up is +Z, Right is +X, and Forward is +Y.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upwards and downwards motion in the world. Positive Z moves the wrist upward relative to the table, and negative Z moves it downward toward the table surface.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move slightly upward (+Z) to lift the wrist out of the dislocated position and relieve pressure off the joint.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to lateral motion to the robot's right relative to the workspace camera view.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move laterally in the negative direction (to the left) to shift the wrist medially and align the dislocated joint.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward and backward motion into and out of the workspace camera view.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move slightly backward (negative Y) along this axis to reposition the wrist along the forearm's natural axis and aid in reducing the dislocation.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with a combination of upward (+Z), medial (-X), and backward (-Y) linear translations. Additionally, rotational motion around the wrist (primarily about the X and Y axes) is required to realign the joint surfaces during the reduction maneuver.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist, we consider:\n\n- Object Properties: The forearm and hand have soft tissue with underlying bone structure. The mass of the forearm and hand estimated at roughly 2 to 3 kg. The tissue is compressible and compliant, with moderate friction against the robot gripper pads. The bone joint will resist dislocation, so some torque is required to overcome stiffness and ligament tension. Estimated static friction at the robot fingertip-forearm interface is medium, ~0.5 coefficient due to soft tissue contact and gripper material.\n\n- Environmental Factors: The forearm rests on a relatively low-friction table surface (wood/particleboard), but is supported fully to avoid large movements due to gravity. Gravity acts downward on the forearm, so some counteracting upward force is needed to lift and reposition the joint. The joint exhibits hinge resistance from the joint capsule and ligaments.\n\n- The relevant object is a human forearm and wrist articulated joint with mass about 2.5 kg, with robot gripper static friction coefficient ~0.5.\n\n- The surface of interaction is the table surface of wood or similar, with static friction coefficient ~0.4 with the forearm.\n\n- Contact Types: The grasp is a firm pinch or wrap grasp around the wrist with distributed contact to maintain a stable hold. The forearm contacts the table, so no slip is allowed at both robot-object and object-table interfaces.\n\n- Motion Type: The motion involves a combination of controlled rotations primarily about the wrist's X-axis and Y-axis to re-seat the joint, combined with translational up and slight lateral and backward push motions. The robot must apply forceful but gentle manipulation to reduce joint displacement, resisting ligament tension and friction.\n\n- Contact Considerations: Forces must be maintained in multiple axes to ensure the wrist is held firmly with no slip while applying rotational torque and linear motions to realign the joint. Maintaining contact force normal to the forearm surface is crucial.\n\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts a combination of linear motion along [x (lateral), y (longitudinal), z (vertical)] and angular torque about [rx (roll) and ry (pitch)], little to no torque about rz (yaw).\n\n- Task duration: The reduction maneuver should be controlled and gentle, requiring approximately 5 to 8 seconds to complete safely.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Forearm mass 2.5 kg, gravity force \u2248 24.5 N downward, friction coefficients ~0.5 robot-forearm, ~0.4 forearm-table.\n\n- Relevant equations: Static friction force fs = \u03bc * N; where N is normal force.\n\n- Relevant assumptions: The joint is hinged with predominant resistance in rotation about X and Y axes; gripper maintains stable grasp without slip; table supports forearm weight.\n\n- Computations: To lift wrist, upward force > weight component, estimate ~30 N upward. Lateral and backward forces to overcome friction and joint resistance estimated at ~10 N each. Torque about X and Y axes to realign joint estimated at 2 N-m each. Minimal torque about Z.\n\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 2.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.5 along the surface: Considering frictions and joint resistance, forces required for motion are computed as above.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon estimated joint stiffness and friction, the object must exert negative force (medial direction) of approximately 10 N to shift the wrist.\n\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task, the object must exert a negative force (backward direction) of approximately 8 N to push the wrist into better alignment.\n\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task, the object must exert a positive (upward) force of approximately 30 N to lift the wrist out of dislocation and off the table surface.\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the object must exert a positive (counterclockwise) torque about the X-axis of approximately 2 N-m to rotate the wrist for joint realignment.\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the object must exert a positive (counterclockwise) torque about the Y-axis of approximately 2 N-m to pitch the wrist into place.\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, no significant torque about the Z-axis is required.\n\nGrasping force: To maintain a stable grasp without slip and apply required forces and torques, the gripper must exert a grasp force in the range of 20 to 30 N, balancing sufficient friction and soft tissue compliance.\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human forearm and wrist, articulated joint with estimated mass 2.5 kg, soft tissue compliance, bone rigidity at joint, robot gripper static friction ~0.5, forearm-table friction ~0.4\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Combined linear motion upward (+Z), medially left (-X), backward (-Y), with counterclockwise torques about X and Y axes to realign dislocated wrist joint\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [-0.05, -0.03, 0.04]  # motions in meters\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [-10, -8, 30, 2, 2, 0]  # forces in N, torques in N-m\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 25\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 7\n```\n[end of motion plan]"
