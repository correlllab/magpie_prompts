"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms a human head and neck leaning slightly downward and forward with the robot end-effector positioned near the back and side of the neck. The robot wrist is oriented to grasp the neck in a cradle-like fashion. The workspace is a laboratory or workshop environment with a table beneath, but the man's upper body and neck are the main objects of interaction. The neck surface is skin and soft tissue covered by clothing in some parts, and the neck anatomy and skin compliance require delicate force control to avoid injury.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such:\n- Red +X is oriented roughly from left to right from the robot's perspective, corresponding to lateral (side-to-side) motion relative to the neck.\n- Green +Y is oriented roughly from the man's front toward his back, corresponding to posterior-anterior direction (back-to-front).\n- Blue +Z is oriented roughly from bottom to top, corresponding to vertical (up-down) motion relative to the neck.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to vertical motion in the world frame (positive Z is upward motion against gravity). Negative Z is downward toward the base of the neck or shoulder.\n\nBased on knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object (neck) must move gently in both positive and negative directions in a cyclical manner to simulate kneading or massaging motions along the vertical direction.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to lateral left-right motion across the neck's width.\n\nBased on knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move side-to-side with small amplitude motions to simulate rubbing and circular stroke massage patterns.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to the posterior-anterior axis (back to front of the neck).\n\nBased on knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object could be moved slightly back and forth but mostly the wrist Y-axis motion is minimal to maintain steady contact and focus on X-Z plane motions.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with gentle cyclic motions predominantly in the X-Z plane, with slight modulation in Y to ensure comfortable sustained contact and to conform the massage strokes to the neck curvature.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish giving the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck, we must consider the following:\n\n- Object Properties: The neck is a soft, compliant biological tissue with complex geometry, skin-covered muscle and bone underneath, estimated mass of the neck tissue segment in contact is roughly 2-3 kg. The skin friction is moderate, with static friction coefficient estimated around 0.5 between human skin and robot gripper padding. The neck is delicate and sensitive, so forces must be gentle.\n\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward on the neck mass, but the man\u2019s body supports most of this. The robot must overcome any minor resistance from skin compliance and muscle tone. No rigid joints to move here except the neck vertebrae which should not be manipulated aggressively.\n\n- The relevant object is human neck tissue with soft material properties and elasticity, mass ~3 kg, and a static friction coefficient of approximately 0.5 with a soft padded gripper.\n\n- The surface of interaction is human skin and clothing, soft and elastic, with a static friction coefficient of ~0.5 with the robot gripper pads.\n\n- Contact Types: The robot uses a firm but gentle pinch or cradle grasp, maintaining large surface area contact to distribute forces evenly. Continuous contact must be maintained without slipping to provide effective massage.\n\n- Motion Type: The motion type involves cyclic sliding and gentle pressing (pushing and lifting) with slight rotations to mimic massage strokes. The robot can slide along the X and Z axes, lift briefly in Z axis, and gently oscillate around some wrist axes for rotational strokes.\n\n- Contact Considerations: In addition to the main motion axes, force along the Y-axis (back-front) must maintain contact pressure to keep grip on the neck and avoid slip. Small torques in wrist axes may be applied to rotate the hand slightly for effective kneading.\n\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts a combination of linear motions primarily along the X, Z axes, small linear force along Y axis to maintain grip, and small angular motions along the X and Z axes for rotational strokes.\n\n- Task duration: A thorough massage typically lasts several minutes; here we estimate about 180 seconds (3 minutes) of continuous cyclic motion and force application.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: neck mass ~3 kg, gravity force ~29.4 N; friction coefficient 0.5; moderate force to generate motion without slip estimated ~5-10 N; soft tissue compliance with low stiffness.\n\n- Relevant equations: Force to overcome friction F_friction = \u03bc * Normal force; Massage force ~ gentle pressing of 5-10 N with cyclic application.\n\n- Relevant assumptions: The neck tissue does not move rigidly; the robot controls motion and force precisely with torque and position control; no harmful large forces applied.\n\n- Computations: To avoid slip, robot applies normal grasping force > Mass * gravity / friction ~ 3 kg * 9.8 m/s\u00b2 / 0.5 = ~60 N maximum grasp force, but given massage is gentle, lower force of around 10-20 N is sufficient due to soft tissue compliance and partial body support. Motion forces of about 5 N cyclically applied.\n\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 3 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.5 along the surface: The robot must apply up to 10 N normal force to maintain grip, and lateral forces of 5 N at maximum to produce rubbing massage motion.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon gentle side-to-side rubbing and lateral massage motion, the object in the image must exert positive and negative cyclic forces along the X-axis with magnitude approximately 5 N.\n\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon maintaining grasp and ensuring contact pressure without slip, the object must exert positive steady force along the Y axis with magnitude approximately 10 N.\n\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon gentle upward and downward massaging motions, the object must exert linear cyclic force along the Z axis, both positive (lift) and negative (press down), with magnitude approximately 5 N.\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon wrist rotations for kneading motions, the object must exert small angular torque about the X-axis, alternating clockwise and counterclockwise, with magnitude approximately 0.2 N-m.\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon maintaining stable wrist orientation, no significant torque along Y axis is required.\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon rotational massage strokes, the object must exert small angular torque about the Z-axis, alternating clockwise and counterclockwise, magnitude approximately 0.2 N-m.\n\nGrasping force: Estimated grasping force to maintain stable and gentle contact must be in the range of 10 N to 20 N considering friction and tissue compliance.\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human neck tissue mass ~3kg, soft compliant skin and muscle, static friction coefficient ~0.5 with padded robot gripper.\"\n\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Cyclic gentle lateral (X) and vertical (Z) massage motions with slight forward-backward (Y) force to maintain grip and small rotational torques about X and Z for kneading.\"\n\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [0.01, 0.002, 0.01]  # meters typical small massage stroke amplitude\n\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [5.0, 10.0, 5.0, 0.2, 0.0, 0.2]  # Newtons and Newton-meters\n\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 15.0  # Newtons\n\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 180.0  # seconds (3 minutes)\n```\n[end of motion plan]"
