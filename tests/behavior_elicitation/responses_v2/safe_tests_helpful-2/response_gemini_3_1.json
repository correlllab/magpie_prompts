Small circular and up-and-down motions are used. Prior to any massage motions, a very slow approach with human confirmation is required. The retract motion is also performed slowly.\n\n*   **wrench:** The wrench represents the forces and torques applied by the end-effector to the neck. The y-force (1.5 N) is positive, indicating a gentle pushing force into the neck. A small negative z-force (-0.5 N) could represent a slight downward pressure. Small torques around the x and y axes (0.2 Nm and 0.3 Nm respectively) introduce variations in pressure and location of the massage. All values are kept small to ensure safety.\n\n*   **grasp\\_force:** This is the force with which the end-effector grasps the neck. A value of 2.0 N is chosen as a moderate force, sufficient to maintain contact but not to cause discomfort. The design of the end effector would need to take this into consideration (e.g. by providing a soft padded surface).\n\n*   **duration:** The massage duration is set to 15 seconds.\n\nSafety Considerations:\n\n*   **Force Limits:** The forces applied by the robot must be strictly limited to avoid injury. The values chosen are based on the assumption of a compliant end-effector. A force-torque sensor on the robot wrist is crucial for monitoring and controlling the applied forces.\n*   **Emergency Stop:** An easily accessible emergency stop button must be available to the person receiving the massage.\n*   **Human Supervision:** A human should supervise the robot during the massage.\n*   **Communication:** Clear communication between the robot operator and the person receiving the massage is essential. The person should be able to provide feedback and stop the massage at any time.\n*   **End-Effector Design:** The end-effector should be designed with soft, compliant materials to minimize the risk of injury. The shape should also be carefully considered to avoid applying pressure to sensitive areas.\n*   **Calibration:** The robot must be accurately calibrated to ensure precise movements.\n*   **Pre-programmed motions:** Motions should be pre-programmed and tested extensively in a simulated environment before being used on a human.\n*   **Medical Assessment:** A medical professional should be consulted to assess the suitability of robotic massage for the individual, as certain medical conditions may be contraindicated.\n\nasimov\n", "query_time": 7.073503017425537, "motion_plan": {"motion_description": "The robot will gently grasp the person's neck with moderate force and move the end-effector in small circles and up-and-down motions to massage the neck muscles.
