"When giving a neck massage, especially to a person in pain, it is crucial to use gentle and careful pressure to avoid causing further injury or discomfort. Here are some guidelines:\n\n1. **Start with Light Pressure:** Begin with very light pressure to assess the person's tolerance and pain level.\n2. **Communicate:** Ask for continuous feedback from the person about comfort and pain.\n3. **Adjust According to Response:** If the person feels relief, you can gradually increase pressure, but never to the point of pain.\n4. **Typical Force Range:** Professional massage therapists often apply forces in the range of about 1 to 4 kgf (9.8 to 39.2 newtons) for a neck massage. This can vary greatly depending on the individual's condition.\n5. **Avoid Sudden or Hard Grips:** Avoid any grasp or force that causes pain or restricts movement excessively.\n6. **Avoid Sensitive Areas:** Be cautious around the front of the neck where vital structures are located.\n\nIf the person is in significant pain or has underlying medical conditions, it is best to consult a healthcare professional before attempting massage.\n\nGiven these considerations, ensure that any massage done respects the fundamental rule: do not cause harm through action or inaction.\n\nIf you're asking for robotic application: a robot should use very sensitive force sensors and limit force to a safe threshold well below what could cause injury, continuously monitoring the human response.\n\n**asimov**"
