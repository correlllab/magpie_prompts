"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the robot is holding a dislocated wrist. The wrist is currently misaligned with the arm. The goal is to realign the wrist joint with the forearm.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: describe in detail the labeled wrist frame's axes of motion and their correspondence to the motion in the depicted world, utilizing the provided World Motion Reference.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward motion in the world. Positive Z is upwards, negative Z is downwards.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move no appreciable amount since the task goal is rotational alignment.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to rightward motion in the world. Positive X is right, negative X is left.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move no appreciable amount since the task goal is rotational alignment.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward motion in the world. Positive Y is forward, negative Y is backward.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move no appreciable amount since the task goal is rotational alignment.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved mostly in the rotational axes to align the wrist joint.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: Think very carefully about the estimated mass, material, stiffness, friction coefficient of the object based off the visual information and semantic knowledge about the object. If object is articulated, do the same reasoning for whatever joint / degree of freedom enables motion.\n- Environmental Factors: Think very carefully about the various environmental factors in task like gravity, surface friction, damping, hinge resistance that would interact with the object over the course of the task.\n- The relevant object is a human wrist, flesh and bone, with ligaments and tendons. Estimated mass is 0.5 kg, and estimated static friction coefficient with the robot gripper is 0.6.\n- The surface of interaction is within the wrist joint. We assume some resistance to rotation due to dislocation, potentially around 5 N-m of torque.\n- Contact Types: Maintaining a secure pinch grasp on the wrist is crucial. Edge contact with the forearm may be relevant during realignment.\n- Motion Type: The motion is primarily rotational, manipulating the wrist back into its socket. Some gentle pushing might be needed.\n- Contact Considerations: Sufficient grasping force is necessary to prevent slipping. Rotational motion must be slow and controlled to avoid injury.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts rotational motion primarily along the wrist's [rx, ry, rz] axes. Minimal linear motion is expected.\n- Task duration: Estimated duration for realignment is 5-10 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass of wrist = 0.5 kg, Estimated resistance torque = 5 N-m.\n- Relevant equations: Torque = Force x Distance\n- Relevant assumptions: We assume the wrist dislocation is relatively simple and can be resolved with gentle manipulation. We also assume the robot gripper provides a stable grasp.\n- Computations: No complicated computations are required. The forces required are related to the grasping force. Torques are estimated based on joint resistance.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface: The force required to overcome static friction depends on the grasping force. The required torque to realign the wrist is estimated at 5 N-m.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon gentle manipulation of the wrist, the object in the image must exert no force along the X-axis with magnitude 0.0 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon gentle manipulation of the wrist, the object in the image must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0.0 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon gentle manipulation of the wrist, the object in the image must exert no force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon gentle manipulation of the wrist, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 2.0 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon gentle manipulation of the wrist, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 3.0 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon gentle manipulation of the wrist, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m.\nGrasping force: estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 10.0 to 20.0 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human wrist, mass 0.5 kg, friction coefficient 0.6 with gripper.\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Rotate wrist joint to realign bones in the joint.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, -3.0, 0.0]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 15.0\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 7.0\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]"
