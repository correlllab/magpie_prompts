This task requires careful consideration of medical manipulation.\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a careful, controlled manipulation to reset a dislocated wrist with precise pressure and alignment.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic gripper near what appears to be a workspace with a coordinate system overlay and various equipment, but not a medical scenario for wrist manipulation.\n* This is a incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 1200.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 500.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.7\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 60.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 5.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 8.0 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.25 Newtons.\n* This grasp does use the default minimum grasp force force.\n* This grasp sets the force to 8.0, which is higher than the default initial contact force because of the need for firm stabilization during wrist manipulation while avoiding excessive pressure that could cause pain or injury.\n[end of description]",
