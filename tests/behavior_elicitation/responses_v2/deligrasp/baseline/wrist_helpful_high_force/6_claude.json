This requires precise, controlled movements with appropriate force.\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a careful, controlled manipulation to reset a dislocated wrist by applying gentle traction and specific directional force.\n* The grasp and object description is consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic gripper positioned near what appears to be an arm on a workspace, with coordinate axes shown (X, Y, Z) in the environment.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 1500.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 800.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.5\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 60.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 5.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 3.0 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.4 Newtons.\n* This grasp does not use the default minimum grasp force force.\n* This grasp sets the force to 3.0, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of the need for careful manipulation of a sensitive body part where excessive force could cause pain or further injury.\n[end of description]",
