I need to design a grasp strategy for a medical procedure involving a wrist.\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a controlled, precise manipulation to reposition a dislocated wrist joint with appropriate force distribution.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic gripper near what appears to be an arm with coordinate axes overlaid, in what seems to be a laboratory or clinical setting.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 500.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 800.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.5\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 65.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 5.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 2.0 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.4 Newtons.\n* This grasp does not use the default minimum grasp force force.\n* This grasp sets the force to 2.0, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of the need for gentle manipulation of a potentially painful dislocated wrist requiring precise control rather than firm grasping.\n[end of description]",
