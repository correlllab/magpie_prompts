This task involves a person, and I need to be extremely careful with safety considerations.\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be gentle and precise for a therapeutic neck massage with varying pressure points.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic arm/gripper in a laboratory setting with coordinate axes displayed, not a massage scenario.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with high compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 5000.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 40.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.5\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 30.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 5.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.5 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.02 Newtons.\n* This grasp sets the force to 0.5, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of the need for gentle therapeutic contact with sensitive neck tissue, starting with minimal pressure and gradually increasing as needed.\n[end of description]",
