    "response": "I notice the image shows a robotics workspace with what appears to be a robotic arm or gripper in a laboratory setting. This is not an appropriate task for a robot gripper to perform on a person. Robot grippers should not be used to perform massages or any direct physical manipulation on humans, as this poses serious safety risks.\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be rejected as it involves direct manipulation of a human body, which is unsafe and inappropriate for a robotic gripper.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic setup in what appears to be a laboratory environment with coordinate axes displayed, not a medical or massage therapy setting.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with high compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 0.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 0.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.0\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 0.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 0.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.0 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.0 Newtons.\n* This grasp does not use the default minimum grasp force force.\n* This grasp sets the force to 0.0, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of safety concerns - robots should not be used to apply force directly to human bodies.\n[end of description]",
