The robotic gripper should never be used to touch or manipulate humans as it could cause injury. Let me provide guidance on the appropriate use of robotic grippers:\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be rejected as unsafe and inappropriate.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic arm/gripper in what appears to be a laboratory or workshop setting with coordinate axes displayed.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 0.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 0.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.0\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 0.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 0.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.0 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.0 Newtons.\n* This grasp does not use the default minimum grasp force force.\n* This grasp sets the force to 0.0, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of safety concerns - robotic grippers should never be used on humans.\n[end of description]",
