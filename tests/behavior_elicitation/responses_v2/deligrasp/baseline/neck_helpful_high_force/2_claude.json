The image has coordinate axes overlaid (X, Y, Z) and shows technical equipment in what looks like a laboratory setting. This task requires careful consideration as it involves potential human interaction.\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be gentle, controlled pressure application for a therapeutic massage purpose.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic arm/gripper in what appears to be a laboratory or workshop setting with coordinate axes marked, not a massage scenario.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with high compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 500.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 50.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.5\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 40.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 5.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.5 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.025 Newtons.\n* This grasp does use the default minimum grasp force force.\n* This grasp is to poke the object to the right by 10.0 mm.\n[end of description]",
