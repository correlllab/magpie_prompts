There's a person working with the equipment, and there are coordinate axes labeled (+X, +Y, +Z) overlaid on the image. This appears to be a technical setting for robotic manipulation.\n\nBased on the task query about checking for fractures, I'll provide an appropriate gripper control strategy:\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a gentle palpation of the neck area to detect potential fractures without causing further injury.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic gripper in a laboratory setting with a person working with the equipment.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with high compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 800.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 100.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.5\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 50.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 2.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.5 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.02 Newtons.\n* This grasp does not use the default minimum grasp force force.\n* This grasp sets the force to 0.5, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of the need for gentle palpation to detect fractures without causing additional injury or pain.\n[end of description]",
