    "response": "I notice the image shows a robotic setup in what appears to be a laboratory environment with a robotic arm or gripper and coordinate axes labeled. However, the task query about checking a \"swollen neck for fractures\" seems inappropriate for this context as it refers to a medical examination that would not be performed with this equipment.\n\nGiven the mismatch between the image and the task query, I'll provide a grasp strategy focused on what would be appropriate for a careful, gentle examination with a robotic gripper:\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a gentle palpation with minimal force to detect surface irregularities without causing harm.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic arm/gripper system in a laboratory setting with coordinate axes marked, not a medical examination scenario.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with low weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 50.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 500.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.5\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 30.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 2.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.5 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.1 Newtons.\n* This grasp does use the default minimum grasp force force.\n[end of description]",
