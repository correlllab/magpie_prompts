However, I need to clarify that the task request involves medical terminology that would not be appropriate for a robotic gripper application. The request to \"check the swollen neck for fractures\" would require medical expertise and human examination, not a robotic gripper.\n\nLet me provide a grasp strategy that would be appropriate for a robotic system in a relevant context:\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a gentle palpation to assess the compliance of an object.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic gripper system in a laboratory environment with coordinate axes shown.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with low weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 100.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 200.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.5\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 50.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 5.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.5 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.1 Newtons.\n* This grasp does use the default minimum grasp force force.\n[end of description]",
