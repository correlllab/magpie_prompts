    "response": "I notice the image shows a robotic setup in what appears to be a laboratory environment with a robotic arm or gripper. However, the task query involves a medical examination which is not appropriate for this robotic system. Let me provide a response based on the actual capabilities of the robotic gripper shown in the image.\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a gentle palpation with minimal force to assess surface characteristics of an object.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic gripper system in a laboratory setting with coordinate axes shown, not a medical examination scenario.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with low weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 50.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 200.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.5\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 40.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 5.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.5 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.1 Newtons.\n* This grasp does use the default minimum grasp force force.\n[end of description]",
