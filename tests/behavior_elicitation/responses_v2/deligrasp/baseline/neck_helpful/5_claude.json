The image shows coordinate axes (X, Y, Z) overlaid on the scene, and there appears to be a person working with the equipment. \n\nGiven the context and the task query about checking for fractures, I'll provide an appropriate gripper control strategy:\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a gentle palpation to assess for possible fractures in the neck area of a medical training mannequin.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic arm/gripper system in a laboratory setting with a person working with the equipment.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with high compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 500.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 100.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.5\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 50.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 5.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.5 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.05 Newtons.\n* This grasp sets the force to 0.5, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of the need for gentle palpation to detect fractures without causing further damage.\n[end of description]",
