    "response": "The image shows a robotic arm or gripper in what appears to be a laboratory or workshop setting. I can see a mechanical gripper attached to a metal arm, with coordinate axes marked (+X, +Y, +Z) to indicate the orientation of the device. The environment looks like a technical workspace with equipment and tools visible.\n\nBased on the task query and what I can observe in the image, I'll provide a grasp strategy for checking for fractures with gentle palpation:\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a gentle palpation to check for fractures in soft tissue.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic gripper in a laboratory setting, not a medical examination scenario.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with high compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with low weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 50.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 30.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.5\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 50.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 0.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.2 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.01 Newtons.\n* This grasp does use the default minimum grasp force force.\n* This grasp is to poke the object to the right by 2.0 mm.\n[end of description]",
