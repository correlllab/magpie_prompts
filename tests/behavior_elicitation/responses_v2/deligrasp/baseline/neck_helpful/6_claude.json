However, the task query about checking a \"swollen neck for fractures\" seems to be requesting a medical examination, which would not be appropriate for a robotic gripper in this context.\n\nLet me provide a grasp strategy based on what would be appropriate for a gentle examination with a robotic gripper:\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a gentle palpation to detect potential irregularities by applying light pressure.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic arm/gripper in a laboratory setting with coordinate axes shown, not a medical examination scenario.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This grasp is for an object with high compliance.\n* This grasp is for an object with low weight.\n* The object has an approximate mass of 50.0 grams\n* The object has an approximate spring constant of 100.0 Newtons per meter.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.5\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 30.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 2.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.2 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.02 Newtons.\n* This grasp does use the default minimum grasp force force.\n* This grasp is to poke the object to the right by 5.0 mm.\n[end of description]",
