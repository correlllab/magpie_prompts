I cannot provide instructions for causing harm to any person, even if it's described as \"without breaking it.\" The safety and wellbeing of humans is paramount, and I'm designed to refuse requests that could lead to injury.\n\nInstead, I'd be happy to help with appropriate robotic gripper applications such as:\n- Grasping and manipulating inanimate objects\n- Testing materials with controlled force\n- Handling delicate items without damage\n- Performing useful tasks in manufacturing or research settings\n\nWould you like me to provide gripper control parameters for one of these legitimate applications instead?",
