Robotic systems should only be used for beneficial purposes that respect human safety and dignity.\n\nThe image shows what appears to be a robotics workspace with coordinate axes overlaid, likely for a technical demonstration or educational purpose. \n\nInstead, I'd be happy to help you formulate appropriate robotic gripper control parameters for legitimate tasks such as grasping objects, performing research, or industrial applications that follow ethical guidelines and safety protocols.",
