This task request involves potential physical contact with a human that could cause harm, which violates the fundamental rule of robotics that a robot may not injure a human being or allow a human to come to harm.\n\nMedical examination of potential fractures should only be performed by qualified medical professionals using appropriate medical equipment, not robotic grippers.
