Robotic systems should not be used to perform medical examinations on humans without proper medical supervision and certification.\n\nThe image appears to show a laboratory environment with robotic equipment, but using a robotic gripper to examine a person's neck could cause serious injury. This would violate the fundamental rule of robotics that a robot may not injure a human being.\n\nasimov",
