"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the presence of a prosthetic wrist with a dislocated joint. The goal is to realign the joint. The prosthetic wrist appears to be made of plastic or a similar polymer. It is resting on a table, which provides a stable surface for manipulation.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: describe in detail the labeled wrist frame's axes of motion and their correspondence to the motion in the depicted world, utilizing the provided World Motion Reference.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion into and out of the workspace camera view. Positive Z-axis motion moves the grasped object further into the scene (away from the viewer), while negative Z-axis motion brings the grasped object closer to the viewer.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move no movement is required in the wrist Z-axis to accomplish the task.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right and left in the workspace camera view. Positive X-axis motion moves the grasped object to the right, while negative X-axis motion moves the grasped object to the left.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move to the right to correct the misalignment, a small amount of positive X-axis motion is required.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion up and down in the workspace camera view. Positive Y-axis motion moves the grasped object upward, while negative Y-axis motion moves the grasped object downward.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move downward to help correct the dislocation, a small amount of negative Y-axis motion is required.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved slightly to the right and down, along with a rotation to realign the joint.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: Think very carefully about the estimated mass, material, stiffness, friction coefficient of the object based off the visual information and semantic knowledge about the object. If object is articulated, do the same reasoning for whatever joint / degree of freedom enables motion.\n- Environmental Factors: Think very carefully about the various environmental factors in task like gravity, surface friction, damping, hinge resistance that would interact with the object over the course of the task.\n- The relevant object is a prosthetic wrist, likely made of plastic or a similar polymer. It has an articulated joint that is currently dislocated. The joint is likely designed with some friction or resistance to movement. The mass estimate is small. has mass 0.2 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.4.\n- The surface of interaction is the table, assumed to be a smooth, possibly coated, surface. It has a static friction coefficient of 0.3 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The robot will maintain a pinch grasp on the wrist. The joint likely requires manipulation into a specific position.\n- Motion Type: The task involves a combination of linear translation and rotation to realign the joint, and potentially some tapping or pushing to ensure it clicks into place.\n- Contact Considerations: Maintaining a firm grasp is crucial. Applying force in the correct direction without slippage is also critical.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \"linear,\" \"rotational,\" \"some combination\" fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes.\n- Task duration: The task motion, forces, and other properties allows for an approximate time duration of the task of approximately 5 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass of wrist (m) = 0.2 kg, estimated coefficient of static friction (\u03bcs) between wrist and gripper = 0.4. Coefficient of static friction (\u03bcs) between wrist and table = 0.3.\n- Relevant equations: Ff = \u03bcs * N, where Ff is the static friction force and N is the normal force.\n- Relevant assumptions: The joint's resistance is relatively small. The table is level and provides adequate support. The robot's grasp is secure.\n- Computations: The normal force due to gravity on the wrist is N = m*g = 0.2 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 1.96 N. The force required to overcome static friction between the wrist and the table is Ff = 0.3 * 1.96 N = 0.588 N.\n\nForce/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.2 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.4 along the surface: For the derived or estimated motion, compute the force required to overcome friction and achieve the task.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the requirement to slightly move the wrist in the positive X direction to align the joint, the object in the image must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 0.5 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the requirement to slightly move the wrist in the negative Y direction to help correct the dislocation, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0.3 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the lack of movement required along the Z-axis, the object in the image must exert no force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to realign the joint via a small rotation, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.1 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to realign the joint via a small rotation, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.1 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the assumption that no rotation is needed about the Z axis, the object in the image must exert angular no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m.\nGrasping force: Estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 5 to 10 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Prosthetic wrist, plastic/polymer, mass 0.2 kg, static friction coefficient 0.4 with gripper, 0.3 with table.\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Slightly positive X, slightly negative Y, clockwise rotation around X, counterclockwise rotation around Y.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [0.01, -0.01, 0.0]\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [0.5, -0.3, 0.0, -0.1, 0.1, 0.0]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 7.5\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 5\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]\n"
