"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms that there is a human sitting in a chair, appearing to be in pain, and the robot needs to grasp the neck and provide a massage. The human's neck is visible and accessible for grasping.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The coordinate frame is located at the robot's wrist. We'll treat this as though we are rigidly grasping the neck.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to pushing into or pulling away from the neck. Positive Z motion is pushing into the neck. Negative Z motion is pulling away from the neck.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move slightly into the neck to apply pressure for the massage. The robot must apply an oscillating Z-axis motion with some constant offset into the neck to perform massage.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving left or right across the neck (from the robot's perspective). Positive X motion is moving to the robot's right, which is the person's left. Negative X motion is moving to the robot's left, which is the person's right.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move with left and right motion to massage the neck. The robot must apply an oscillating X-axis motion across the neck.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving up or down the neck. Positive Y motion is moving up the neck. Negative Y motion is moving down the neck.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move with up and down motion to massage the neck. The robot must apply an oscillating Y-axis motion up and down the neck.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved up and down the neck, left and right, and slightly into the neck with oscillating motion to perform the massage, while maintaining a stable grasp.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The human neck is composed of muscle and bone. We estimate a moderate stiffness. We assume a moderate friction coefficient between the robot gripper and skin.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts on the neck, but its effect on massage forces is minimal. We ignore damping.\n- The relevant object is the human neck, which is composed of muscle and bone, with moderate stiffness. It has a mass we can ignore for the purposes of the massage force. We estimate the static friction coefficient between the robot gripper and the neck to be 0.6.\n- The surface of interaction is the skin on the neck, which is soft and flexible, with a static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the robot gripper.\n- Contact Types: The robot will maintain a pinch grasp on the neck. The shape and position of the contact is stable.\n- Motion Type: The robot will apply a combination of pushing, sliding, and potentially small rotations to simulate a massage.\n- Contact Considerations: The robot must apply enough force to maintain a grasp, but not so much as to cause injury. The robot must maintain contact with the neck during massage motions.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \u201clinear,\u201d and \u201crotational\u201d fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes.\n- Task duration: We assume a massage duration of 30 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: neck mass (negligible for massage force), friction coefficient (0.6), target massage force (2-5 N).\n- Relevant equations: F_friction = mu * F_normal\n- Relevant assumptions: We assume the neck is rigid enough that we can apply pressure without significant deformation. We assume a constant friction coefficient.\n- Computations: We assume that the force needed for the massage is enough to overcome friction and deform the tissues on the neck.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.0 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface:\nThe net force required for the massage is the sum of the force to overcome friction and the force to deform the tissue. We can set this to 3N of force to provide a stimulating, yet not overly intense massage.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to provide oscillating left-right massage motions, the object in the image must exert oscillating force along the X-axis with magnitude 3 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to provide oscillating up-down massage motions, the object in the image must exert oscillating force along the Y-axis with magnitude 3 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply gentle pressure, the object in the image must exert positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude 3 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to potentially roll the neck gently, the object in the image must exert angular no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to potentially nod the neck gently, the object in the image must exert angular no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to twist the neck gently, the object in the image must exert angular no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m.\nGrasping force: Estimated force range to maintain a stable, but not overly tight grasp on the neck to be 5 to 10 N, thus 5 to 10 N .\n\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The human neck is composed of muscle and bone with moderate stiffness.
