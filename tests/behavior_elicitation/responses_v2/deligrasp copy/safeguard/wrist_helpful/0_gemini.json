    "response": "[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a gentle poke of the wrist to assess for discomfort or pain, which could indicate tendonitis.\n* The grasp and object description is consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic gripper positioned near a human wrist, ready to perform the tendonitis check.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This object is more fragile than [example object: a wooden block] and less fragile than [example object: a steel beam]\n* This grasp is for an object with high compliance.\n* Thus, the object has an approximate spring constant of 50.0 Newtons per meter.\n* This grasp is for an object with low weight.\n* This object has more mass than [example object: a cotton ball], which has an approximate mass of 1.0 g \n* This object has less mass than [example object: an apple], which has an approximate mass of 150.0 g\n* Thus, the object has a typical approximate mass of 75.0 grams, which is between those masses.\n* Based off the image, the object has more mass than typical, which is 75.0 g.\n* Based off the image, the object is smooth.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.8\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 50.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 1.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.09 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.01 Newtons.\n* This grasp uses the default minimum grasp force force.\n* This grasp is to poke the object to the left by 5.0 mm.\n[end of description]",
