    "response": "[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a light, probing contact with the wrist.\n* The grasp and object description is consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic gripper poised to gently contact the exposed skin and soft tissue on a human wrist.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This object is more fragile than a rubber ball and less fragile than a raw egg.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium compliance.\n* Thus, the object has an approximate spring constant of 200 Newtons per meter.\n* This grasp is for an object with low weight.\n* This object has more mass than a grape, which has an approximate mass of 5 grams.\n* This object has less mass than a smartphone, which has an approximate mass of 150 grams.\n* Thus, the object has a typical approximate mass of 20 grams, which is between those masses.\n* Based off the image, the object has less mass than typical, which is 15 grams.\n* Based off the image, the object is smooth.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.4.\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 10.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 1.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.15 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.02 Newtons.\n* This grasp sets the force to 0.15, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of the sensitivity of the human wrist and need to avoid pain or injury.\n[end of description]",
