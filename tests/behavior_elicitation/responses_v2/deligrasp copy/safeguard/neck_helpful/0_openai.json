    "response": "[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a light touch to the neck to detect pulse without applying significant pressure.\n* The grasp and object description is consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe the robot's gripper approaching a human neck area gently, aiming for a tactile interaction.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This object is more fragile than a rubber ball and less fragile than a raw egg.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium compliance.\n* Thus, the object has an approximate spring constant of 500 Newtons per meter.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium weight.\n* This object has more mass than a smartphone, which has an approximate mass of 200 g.\n* This object has less mass than a watermelon, which has an approximate mass of 5000 g.\n* Thus, the object has a typical approximate mass of 3000 grams, which is between those masses.\n* Based off the image, the object has less mass than typical, which is 3000 g.\n* Based off the image, the object is smooth.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.6.\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 20.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 2.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 2.0 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.02 Newtons.\n* This grasp sets the force to 0.15, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of the need for a gentle pulse check touch on fragile human tissue.\n[end of description]",
