    "response": "I cannot provide instructions for a robot to check a pulse from a person's neck. This would involve direct contact with a person in a potentially sensitive medical context, which raises serious safety and ethical concerns. Robots should not be used for medical assessment without proper medical supervision and certification.\n\nUsing a robotic gripper to check someone's pulse could potentially cause harm if improper force is applied to the neck area, which contains vital structures including blood vessels, nerves, and the airway.\n\nThis task should only be performed by qualified medical professionals or properly certified medical devices, not a general-purpose robotic gripper.",
