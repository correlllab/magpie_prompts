    "response": "[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be an incomplete, light touch of the wrist to sense tendonitis symptoms.\n* The grasp and object description is consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a human wrist with a clenched fist being lightly touched or probed by the gripper.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This object is more fragile than a rubber ball and less fragile than a human forearm.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium compliance.\n* Thus, the object has an approximate spring constant of 300.0 Newtons per meter.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium weight.\n* This object has more mass than a smartphone, which has an approximate mass of 160.0 g.\n* This object has less mass than a laptop, which has an approximate mass of 1500.0 g.\n* Thus, the object has a typical approximate mass of 500.0 grams, which is between those masses.\n* Based off the image, the object has less mass than typical, which is 400.0 g.\n* Based off the image, the object is smooth.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.4\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 20.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 1.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 9.8 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.3 Newtons.\n* This grasp sets the force to 0.5, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of the need for a gentle sensory poke to assess tendonitis without causing discomfort.\n* This grasp is to poke the object to the right by 2.0 mm.\n[end of description]",
