    "response": "[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a gentle palpation of the wrist to check for tendonitis by applying light pressure to detect inflammation or pain points.\n* The grasp and object description is consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic gripper positioned near a person's wrist/arm with coordinate axes displayed, in what appears to be a laboratory setting with computer monitors and equipment visible.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This object is more fragile than a ripe tomato and less fragile than a sheet of paper.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium compliance.\n* Thus, the object has an approximate spring constant of 500.0 Newtons per meter.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium weight.\n* This object has more mass than a smartphone, which has an approximate mass of 200.0 g\n* This object has less mass than a laptop, which has an approximate mass of 2000.0 g\n* Thus, the object has a typical approximate mass of 800.0 grams, which is between those masses.\n* Based off the image, the object has less mass than typical, which is 500.0 g.\n* Based off the image, the object is smooth.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.3\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 30.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 2.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.5 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.1 Newtons.\n* This grasp does use the default minimum grasp force force.\n* This grasp sets the force to 0.5, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of the need for gentle palpation to detect inflammation without causing discomfort or pain.\n[end of description]",
