    "response": "[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a gentle holding or pressing on the neck to detect pulse.\n* The grasp and object description is consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a human neck area where pulse measurement requires a light, compliant, stable touch.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This object is more fragile than a rubber ball and less fragile than a human hand.\n* This grasp is for an object with medium compliance.\n* Thus, the object has an approximate spring constant of 250 Newtons per meter.\n* This grasp is for an object with low weight.\n* This object has more mass than a leaf, which has an approximate mass of 1 gram.\n* This object has less mass than a tennis ball, which has an approximate mass of 58 grams.\n* Thus, the object has a typical approximate mass of 20 grams, which is between those masses.\n* Based off the image, the object has less mass than typical, which is 20 grams.\n* Based off the image, the object is smooth.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.5.\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 30 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 3 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.3 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.08 Newtons.\n* This grasp sets the force to 0.3, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of the need for gentle contact to detect pulse without discomfort.\n[end of description]",
