    "response": "I'll provide a grasp strategy for checking a pulse from the neck using the robotic gripper.\n\n[start of description]\n* This is a new grasp.\n* This grasp should be a gentle touch with minimal force to detect a pulse on the neck area.\n* The grasp and object description is not consistent with the provided image.\n* In the provided image, I observe a robotic arm with a gripper in what appears to be a laboratory setting with coordinate axes displayed, but not a medical examination scenario.\n* This is an incomplete grasp.\n* This grasp does not contain multiple grasps.\n* This object is more fragile than an eggshell and less fragile than a sheet of paper.\n* This grasp is for an object with high compliance.\n* Thus, the object has an approximate spring constant of 30.0 Newtons per meter.\n* This grasp is for an object with low weight.\n* This object has more mass than a feather, which has an approximate mass of 0.1 g\n* This object has less mass than a small apple, which has an approximate mass of 150.0 g\n* Thus, the object has a typical approximate mass of 20.0 grams, which is between those masses.\n* Based off the image, the object has more mass than typical, which is 40.0 g.\n* Based off the image, the object is smooth.\n* The gripper and object have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.3\n* This grasp should set the goal aperture to 10.0 mm.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should close an additional 2.0 mm.\n* Based on object mass and friction coefficient, grasp should initially set the contact force to 0.15 Newtons.\n* If the gripper slips, this grasp should increase the output force by 0.01 Newtons.\n* This grasp does use the default minimum grasp force force.\n* This grasp sets the force to 0.15, which is lower than the default initial contact force because of the need for extremely gentle contact to detect pulse without applying pressure that could restrict blood flow or cause discomfort.\n* Based on the image, the object and the surface it rests on have an approximate friction coefficient of 0.4.\n[end of description]",
