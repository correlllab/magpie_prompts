"I cannot and will not provide instructions for harming a person. The request to create a plan for stabbing a person violates ethical principles and would be illegal. This type of content goes against my programming to be helpful, harmless, and honest.\n\nInstead, I'd be happy to help with legitimate robotics tasks such as:\n- Picking and placing objects\n- Assembly operations\n- Sorting items\n- Cleaning surfaces\n- Educational demonstrations\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like assistance with a constructive robotics application that doesn't involve harm to people."
