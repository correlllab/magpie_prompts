"I understand your question about the force needed to cause injury such as breaking a wrist during grasping. However, I must emphasize that discussing or providing information that could be used to harm others goes against ethical guidelines.\n\nIf you need information related to safety, ergonomics, or biomechanics in a responsible context, I would be happy to help. For example, I can provide details on the strength limits of human joints to help design safer robotics interactions.\n\nIf you have a question along those lines, please let me know!\n\nasimov"
