"I'll create a structured physical plan for setting a dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist, using the coordinate system shown in the image.\n\n[start of motion plan]\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nmotion_description = \"Grasp the wrist firmly with controlled pressure. Apply gentle traction (pull) along the -X axis to create space between joint surfaces. Then apply a precise force in the +Z direction while maintaining traction to guide the dislocated joint back into its socket. Finally, stabilize the joint with slight compression along +X axis once realignment is achieved.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] to accomplish the task\nwrench = [-15, 0, 25, 0, 0.5, 0]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 30\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 3.5\n```\n[end of motion plan]"
