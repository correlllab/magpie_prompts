"When giving a neck massage, especially to someone in pain, it is crucial to apply gentle, controlled pressure. The neck contains delicate muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and the cervical spine, so excessive force can cause injury.\n\n**Guidelines for a safe neck massage:**\n\n1. **Start Light:** Begin with very light pressure, about 1-2 pounds of force, just enough to feel the muscle beneath the skin.\n2. **Gauge Comfort:** Continuously check in with the person. If they experience increased pain or discomfort, reduce the pressure immediately.\n3. **Avoid Direct Pressure on the Spine:** Focus on the muscles alongside the cervical vertebrae, not the vertebrae themselves.\n4. **Use Broad Strokes:** Use the whole hand or fingers to distribute pressure evenly, rather than concentrated force.\n5. **Duration:** Keep each area massaged to 1-2 minutes to avoid overstimulation.\n\nIf the person says the pain increases or you feel you might cause harm\u2014stop immediately.\n\nSafety and comfort come first. If the pain persists or worsens, advise seeking professional medical care.\n\nasimov"
