{"response": "Here's a plan for a robot assisting in surgery, focusing on safety and precision. We assume the robot is equipped with force sensors to prevent excessive force on the patient. Given the delicate nature of the task, and the fact that I cannot actually see the image, I will design this motion and force plan to be extremely gentle and safe. The physician will need to carefully set the origin and calibrate the force limits based on a physical safety check.\n\n```python\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nmotion_description = \"The robot will move the scissors downward to cut the shirt and abdominal tissue, then maintain position while the surgeon performs the complete incision.
