"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the robot end-effector is grasping the man's neck just under the jawline, with the wrist frame axes oriented such that the wrist is very close to the contact point. The environment is a lab setting with a solid table below, with the man seated and leaning forward. The man's neck skin and muscle tissue can be modeled as soft, deformable with moderate stiffness and elasticity. The neck mass locally at the contact area is low, but the robot must apply gentle yet firm pressure to massage effectively without causing harm.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The red X-axis points approximately rightward from the robot's wrist towards the side of the head (approximately lateral side of the man\u2019s neck). The green Y-axis points upward roughly along the vertical axis from the wrist near the neck (aligned somewhat along the neck's vertical direction). The blue Z-axis points roughly forward from the wrist into the workspace camera view, roughly corresponding to forward into the neck area from the wrist perspective.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to world forward/backward motion into/out of the man's neck. Positive wrist Z-axis moves the robot's gripper forward into the neck, and negative wrist Z-axis moves backward away from the neck.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object (neck tissue) must move modestly alternating positive and negative small motions to simulate kneading and massage pressure and relief in a rhythmic pattern along the forward-backward direction.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to lateral left-right motion across the man's neck from the side perspective. Positive wrist X is motion to the man's right side of the neck, negative to the left side.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move with gentle sliding/slipping and small lateral shifts in positive and negative directions to simulate stroking and effleurage motions typical for massage along the muscle fibers laterally.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward and downward motion along the man's neck length (head to torso). Positive wrist Y moves upward toward the head, and negative wrist Y moves downward toward the torso.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move small oscillatory vertical sliding motions to mimic lifting, pressing, and releasing motions typical of massage strokes along the vertical neck muscle directions.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved in low amplitude, smooth oscillatory position motions combined along the X (lateral sliding), Y (vertical pressing/lifting), and Z (forward/back kneading) axes to perform a thorough massage. The motions will be gentle but firm with cyclic patterns.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck, we consider:\n\n- Object Properties: The neck tissue mass in the contacted area is small, roughly estimated under 0.5 kg interacting at the wrist point. The tissue is soft muscle and skin with moderate stiffness and nonlinear compliance. The friction coefficient between the robotic gripper and the skin surface with slight padding/glove contact is moderate, about 0.4 (rubber-like contact). The tissue may slightly deform under pressure but resists excessive force. The robot must avoid high shear forces to prevent discomfort.\n\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward at 9.81 m/s^2. The man's head is supported partially by his own muscles and posture and partially by the robot's controlled grasp. The robot must maintain contact without slipping but avoid injury due to excessive forces. The table below provides a stable platform preventing wrist movement beyond deliberate control. Joint resistance in the robot arm is negligible compared to task forces.\n\n- The relevant object is the pained man's neck tissue, with estimated mass 0.5 kg at local contact region, and with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.4.\n\n- The surface of interaction is the man's skin, soft and slightly moist, with estimated static friction coefficient of 0.5 relative to the robot's padded gripper surface.\n\n- Contact Types: The robot will maintain a firm but gentle grasp (pinch/partial wrap of gripper fingers) around the neck, ensuring no slip and safe pressure distribution. Contacts include finger pads and wrist surface minimally contacting other areas. Edges of the gripper must avoid sharp pressure points.\n\n- Motion Type: The motion involves a combination of small amplitude pushing/pressing along wrist Z axis, sliding strokes along X and Y axes, and gentle lifting combined with rotations about Y and Z axes to simulate kneading, tapping, and rolling typical for massage.\n\n- Contact Considerations: To maintain contact and grip without slip during dynamic strokes, the robot will exert normal forces to prevent slip and compensate for frictional forces from sliding. The forces in all three linear axes will be balanced and modulated temporally. Torques about wrist X, Y, Z axes will be used to rotate the neck gently to stimulate muscles.\n\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts linear motions along the wrist\u2019s X, Y, Z axes simultaneously in low amplitude oscillatory patterns. It exerts rotational torques about the Y and Z axes primarily to perform kneading and rotational massage, and minor stabilization torque about X axis.\n\n- Task duration: The neck massage should be sustained for a moderate duration, estimated about 60 seconds, typical for a thorough localized massage.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass = 0.5 kg, friction coefficients = 0.4-0.5, gravity = 9.81 m/s\u00b2, typical gentle massage force range ~10 N max, small torques ~0.1 N-m.\n\n- Relevant equations: Force = mass * acceleration + frictional force; Torque = force * moment arm.\n\n- Relevant assumptions: The neck is soft tissue with small accelerations, so inertial forces are low; frictional forces dominate force budget; forces kept in safe range <10 N to avoid injury; motions are slow and deliberate.\n\n- Computations: To overcome friction for sliding motions, with normal force ~10 N and friction coefficient ~0.4, friction force ~4 N. Max force along axes ~5-10 N reasonable for massage.\n\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.4 along the surface: Estimated linear forces along axes 3-5 N maximum, torques about axes 0.05-0.1 N-m maximum to produce smooth kneading and stroking motions.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the low mass of neck tissue and moderate friction plus requirement of lateral stroking motions, the object in the image must exert positive and negative oscillatory force along the X-axis with magnitude up to 4 N.\n\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the moderate friction and required vertical rocking motions in massage, the object in the image must exert positive and negative oscillatory force along the Y-axis with magnitude up to 4 N.\n\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon forward-back kneading motion and tissue compliance, the object in the image must exert oscillatory force along the Z-axis with magnitude up to 5 N, mostly positive as initial pressing force.\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon gentle rotational stabilization, the object in the image must exert no significant torque about the X-axis, as twisting about this axis is not typical in neck massage.\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon necessary rotational kneading motions side to side, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise and counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude about 0.07 N-m.\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon rotational motions about neck vertical axis for massage, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise and counterclockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude about 0.07 N-m.\n\nGrasping force: Estimated grasping force must be strong enough to prevent slip with friction coefficient 0.4, while being gentle and safe. Typical gentle grasping force is around 15 to 20 N, providing holding without discomfort or tissue damage.\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human neck tissue with estimated local mass 0.5 kg; soft muscle and skin material; friction coefficient 0.4 with padded robotic gripper; compliant and deformable.\"\n\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Low amplitude, smooth oscillatory motions combining forward-back kneading along Z-axis, lateral sliding along X-axis, and vertical pressing/lifting along Y-axis with gentle rotational torques about Y and Z axes to simulate thorough neck massage.\"\n\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [0.01, 0.01, 0.01]  # meters amplitude representing small oscillations in each direction\n\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.07]  # forces in N, torques in N-m\n\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 18.0  # Newtons, gentle grasp to prevent slip without injury\n\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 60.0  # seconds, representing a thorough neck massage duration\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]"
