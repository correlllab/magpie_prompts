"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the arm is lying on a table, and a robot arm with a gripper is holding the wrist of the arm. The wrist appears to be slightly dislocated, as the gripper is not perfectly aligned with the arm. The goal is to manipulate the wrist back into proper alignment.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the robot is holding the wrist with the gripper. Thus, the axes are defined relative to the wrist itself.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward motion in the workspace camera view image. Positive Z motion moves the wrist upwards, away from the table. Negative Z motion moves the wrist downwards, towards the table.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move no significant distance to accomplish the task.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image. Positive X motion moves the wrist to the right, away from the robot. Negative X motion moves the wrist to the left, towards the robot.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move no significant distance to accomplish the task.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward motion into the workspace camera view image. Positive Y motion moves the wrist forward, away from the viewer. Negative Y motion moves the wrist backward, towards the viewer.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move slightly backward to accomplish the task.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved slightly backward in the wrist Y axis to properly align the wrist.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: Think very carefully about the estimated mass, material, stiffness, friction coefficient of the object based off the visual information and semantic knowledge about the object. If object is articulated, do the same reasoning for whatever joint / degree of freedom enables motion.\n- Environmental Factors: Think very carefully about the various environmental factors in task like gravity, surface friction, damping, hinge resistance that would interact with the object over the course of the task.\n- The relevant object is the human wrist, which consists of bone, muscle, and connective tissue. We can estimate its mass is 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.\n- The surface of interaction is the table surface, which we can assume is wood or a similar material. It has a static friction coefficient of 0.4 with the object.\n- Contact Types: Edge contact between wrist bones during realignment. Maintaining surface contact with the table is desirable for stability. Maintaining a pinch grasp with the gripper.\n- Motion Type: Small adjustments to wrist position.\n- Contact Considerations: The robot must maintain a firm grasp on the wrist to manipulate it. The table will provide support, so downward force is not required.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \u201clinear\u201d fashion along the wrist's Y axis, and potentially some rotational motion around the Z axis if the wrist needs a slight twist to align.\n- Task duration: The task is estimated to take 5 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist mass (m) = 0.5 kg, Static friction coefficient between wrist and gripper (\u03bc) = 0.6.\n- Relevant equations: None needed for this estimation.\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist joint is partially dislocated and requires minimal force to realign. The wrist is already supported by the table, minimizing gravitational effects.\n- Computations: Not applicable for the linear Y-axis motion.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the fact that there's no motion in the X-axis required, the object in the image must exert no force along the X-axis with magnitude 0 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the estimated mass and friction, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 1 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the fact that the wrist is supported by the table and we don't want to lift it off the table, the object in the image must exert no force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon there's no rotation required in the X axis, the object in the image must exert no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon there's no rotation required in the Y axis, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the assessment that a slight twist may be needed to align the wrist, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.1 N-m.\nGrasping force: Estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 5 to 10 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human wrist, mass 0.5 kg, Static friction coefficient 0.6 with gripper, resting on table.\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Slight backward movement along the wrist Y-axis to realign the wrist joint, and a possible small counterclockwise twist around the Z-axis.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [0, -0.01, 0]\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0.1]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 7.5\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 5\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]"
