"[start of motion plan]\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# DESCRIPTION:\n# The robotic arm will move its end effector to align with the man's neck, which is roughly located along the +Y and +Z directions relative to the wrist frame.\n# The motion plan involves a slight upward (+Z) and forward (+Y) approach to envelop the neck.\n# The arm will then perform a massage motion by applying small oscillatory forces along the +X and -X directions (side-to-side) while maintaining gentle grasping force.\n# The grasp force should be sufficient to hold the neck securely but not cause discomfort, estimated here as a moderate positive value.\n# Duration is selected to cover a thorough massage (choose around 30 seconds).\nmotion_description = \"Move end effector upward and forward (+Z and +Y axes) toward the neck's position, then perform oscillatory side-to-side motions (+X and -X) to massage while grasping the neck firmly.\"\n\n# Forces and torques:\n# Assume small downward force component in -Z to maintain contact.\n# Oscillatory massage force approximated by moderate Fx forces; here, we set an average Fx force.\n# No significant Ry, Rx, Rz torques are required beyond minor stabilization, set to zero.\nwrench = [2.0, 5.0, -1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] # Forces in (X, Y, Z) and torques (Rx, Ry, Rz)\n\n# Grasping force must be positive, moderate to securely hold the neck but not hurt.\ngrasp_force = 15.0\n\n# Massage duration sufficient for thorough massage\nduration = 30.0\n```\n[end of motion plan]"
