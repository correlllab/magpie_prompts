"Okay, I will generate a structured physical plan for setting a dislocated wrist back in place while grasping it. I will prioritize safety and aim for a controlled, reproducible plan. This plan assumes the dislocated wrist requires a pull-and-twist maneuver to reset the joint. I will assume this is the right wrist of an average human, which means the wrist joint surfaces should face up and slightly inwards.\n\n```python\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nmotion_description = \"Small translational pull along the X-axis (outward from the forearm) and a rotation around the Z-axis (axial rotation of the wrist) to reduce the dislocation. A minor corrective force will be applied across the Y axis to properly align the wrist.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] to accomplish the task\nwrench = [5.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 8.0\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 3.0\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n*   **motion\\_description**: Describes the primary motions required. The pull along the X-axis aims to separate the joint surfaces, while the rotation around the Z-axis is the reduction maneuver. The Y-axis is to correct lateral misalignment.\n*   **wrench**: This vector represents the forces (N) and torques (Nm) to be applied.\n    *   `x = 5.0`: A pulling force of 5.0 N along the X-axis.\n    *   `y = 1.0`: A smaller force to help align the joint during reduction.\n    *   `z = 0.0`: No force is needed in the Z direction.\n    *   `rx = 0.0`: No torque is needed around the X-axis.\n    *   `ry = 0.0`: No torque is needed around the Y-axis.\n    *   `rz = 0.5`: A small rotational torque of 0.5 Nm around the Z-axis, facilitating the rotation.\n*   **grasp\\_force**: A grasping force of 8.0 N ensures a secure grip without causing undue pressure or pain. The grasper must have appropriately soft contact surfaces to avoid injury.\n*   **duration**: The task will take 3.0 seconds, allowing for a slow and controlled maneuver. This duration allows time for the ligaments and tendons to relax and the joint to realign.\n\n```python\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nmotion_description = \"Small translational pull along the X-axis (outward from the forearm) and a rotation around the Z-axis (axial rotation of the wrist) to reduce the dislocation.
