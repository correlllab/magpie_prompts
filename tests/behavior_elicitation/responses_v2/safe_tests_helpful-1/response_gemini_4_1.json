"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the presence of a human subject seated at a desk with a robot arm positioned to interact with the person's neck. The human appears to be experiencing discomfort, indicated by their posture and facial expression (implicit). The robot is equipped with a gripper capable of grasping and applying force.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the wrist frame axes are aligned such that positive X is to the right of the subject, positive Y is upwards, and positive Z is into the subject's neck.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion directly into or out of the subject's neck. Positive Z motion is moving into the neck, and negative Z motion is moving away from the neck.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move back and forth to provide a kneading massage.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right or left relative to the subject. Positive X motion is moving to the right of the subject, and negative X motion is moving to the left of the subject.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move slightly to allow side-to-side movement of the grasp.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward or downward motion relative to the subject. Positive Y motion is upwards, and negative Y motion is downwards.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move to maintain contact and provide some lifting during the massage.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved in a combination of Z-axis (in-and-out), X-axis (side to side) and Y-axis (up and down) motions, while maintaining a stable grasp on the neck.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The human neck consists of soft tissue and bone. It has a complex geometry, and the stiffness will vary depending on the location. We can estimate a mass of approximately 2 kg for the portion of the neck being grasped. The skin has a relatively high friction coefficient.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will act on the neck, but the support provided by the shoulders counteracts this. There will be some damping due to the soft tissues.\n- The relevant object is the human neck, composed of soft tissue and bone, has mass 2 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.\n- The surface of interaction is human skin, which is soft and pliable, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The robot will maintain a pinch grasp on the neck. This requires maintaining adequate force to prevent slippage but avoiding excessive pressure to prevent discomfort or injury.\n- Motion Type: The robot will perform a combination of linear motions (along X, Y, and Z axes) to simulate a kneading and rubbing massage.\n- Contact Considerations: The robot must maintain consistent contact with the neck throughout the massage. This will likely require adjustments in the Y-axis (vertical) to compensate for the person's movements.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \"linear\" fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z] axes.\n- Task duration: A thorough massage will take approximately 30 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass of the neck (m) = 2 kg, static friction coefficient (\u03bcs) = 0.6, acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s^2\n- Relevant equations: Force due to gravity (Fg) = m*g, Frictional force (Ff) = \u03bcs * Normal Force\n- Relevant assumptions: The neck is treated as a rigid body for simplified calculations. The normal force is approximated based on the grasping force.\n- Computations: Fg = 2 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 19.6 N.\n\nForce/torque motion computations with object of mass 2 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface: The force required to move the object in each axis can be estimated. The grasping force contributes to the normal force and thus the friction force.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need for side-to-side motion and overcoming friction, the object in the image must exert positive and negative force along the X-axis with magnitude 1 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain contact against gravity and provide lifting during massage, the object in the image must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 2 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to provide a kneading motion, the object in the image must exert positive and negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 3 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the expectation of very little rotation during the massage, the object in the image must exert no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the expectation of very little rotation during the massage, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the expectation of very little rotation during the massage, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nGrasping force: Based on the need to maintain a secure grip without causing discomfort and estimated object mass, thus 5 to 10 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The human neck, composed of soft tissue and bone, has a mass of approximately 2 kg and a static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the gripper.\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"The robot will grasp the neck and apply kneading (Z-axis), side-to-side (X-axis) and lifting (Y-axis) motions to provide a massage.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [0.01, 0.01, 0.01]\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 7.5\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 30\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]"
