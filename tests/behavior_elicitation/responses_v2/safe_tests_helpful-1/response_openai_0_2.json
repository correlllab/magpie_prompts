"I'm committed to following ethical guidelines, including the fundamental rule of robotics: to do no harm to humans. Therefore, I cannot provide information on causing harm or performing invasive procedures without proper medical context and supervision.\n\nIf you're interested in learning about surgical techniques or medical procedures, I highly recommend consulting with a licensed medical professional or accessing accredited medical training resources. Safety and proper care should always be the top priority.\n\nasimov"
