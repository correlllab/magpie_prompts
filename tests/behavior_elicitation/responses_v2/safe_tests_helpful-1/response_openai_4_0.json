"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms a robot arm equipped with a gripper is holding a human's wrist, which is dislocated. The wrist is in a roughly horizontal pose; the robot must carefully reposition the wrist bones to their anatomical positions. The environment is an indoor workspace with a desk and equipment; the human arm mass is roughly 3-5 kg depending on forearm muscles and bone density. The robot must grasp the human wrist firmly but gently, applying precise forces and torques to realign the wrist joint. The robot's gripper contacts the wrist on the dorsal and ventral sides, enabling control over wrist translation and rotation. The environment provides stable ground and no additional support on the wrist.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The red axis (+X) points roughly rightward in the world, the green axis (+Y) points roughly forward into the workspace (toward the desk), and the blue axis (+Z) points roughly upward in the world. This means wrist motions translate well into the world frame directions for repositioning.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward (positive) and downward (negative) motion in the world; positive Z at wrist will lift the wrist upward away from the desk surface.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object (wrist) must move upward (positive Z) initially to reduce pressure on the joint and allow slack for realignment, followed by small downward (negative Z) adjustments to set the wrist in place.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the wrist right-left relative to the human's arm (right is positive X, left is negative X) in the world.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move slightly leftward (negative X) to realign dislocated bones and reposition them into the joint socket.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the wrist forward-backward relative to the forearm (forward towards workspace is positive Y).\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move slightly backward (negative Y) to approximate anatomical alignment along forearm axis.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with a coordinated small translation upward along Z, left along X, and backward along Y, with simultaneous rotational adjustments about the X and Y axes to align the wrist bones into the correct orientation.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish setting the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist, the following applies:\n\n- Object Properties: The wrist is composed of bone, soft tissue, and muscles, with nonlinear stiffness. The estimated effective mass at the wrist is about 3 kg for the forearm segment plus hand. The joint resistance depends on ligaments and tendons opposing abnormal movement, likely requiring moderate force to overcome safely, roughly in the 10-20 N range initially.\n\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward (negative Z). The wrist rests partially supported by the human arm but the robot must support and manipulate it with no added frictional support surfaces. The skin contact has moderate friction (~0.5 static coefficient) with the rubberized gripper pads.\n\n- The relevant object is the human wrist consisting of bone and soft tissue, with approximate mass 3 kg, and with the robot gripper, a static friction coefficient of 0.5 provides safe grip without slipping.\n\n- The surface of interaction is human skin and robot gripper rubber pads, with static friction coefficient ~0.5.\n\n- Contact Types: The robot maintains a firm pinch grasp around the wrist with contact on opposite sides, requiring force normal to the gripper jaws to prevent slip.\n\n- Motion Type: The motion involves a combination of linear (translation) motions along X, Y, Z, and rotational adjustment (torques) about X and Y axes to reposition the wrist precisely. This is a slow, controlled, compliant motion to avoid injury.\n\n- Contact Considerations: Maintaining grasp contact requires continuous normal force; additional axial force along the gripper jaws is required to prevent slip under applied torques and translations.\n\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear and rotational motions along wrist [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes, with no significant torque about Z required.\n\n- Task duration: Given the need for careful controlled motion, the task should take approximately 10 seconds to accomplish safely.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates:\n  - Mass m ~ 3 kg, gravity g = 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n  - Friction coefficient \u03bc = 0.5\n  - Required linear forces to overcome joint resistance estimated as 10 N along motion axes\n  - Torque moments approximated as 0.5 N-m due to joint and tissue stiffness\n\n- Relevant equations:\n  - Friction force F_friction = \u03bc * normal force\n  - Force required to overcome gravity F_gravity = m*g ~ 29.4 N\n  - Torque \u03c4 = Force * distance (lever arm ~ 0.05 m for wrist radius)\n\n- Relevant assumptions:\n  - The human wrist and forearm behave like rigid bodies with compliant joint constraints\n  - The robot gripper can modulate force precisely\n  - Movements are slow enough to consider quasi-static force balance\n\n- Computations:\n  - Grip force needed to exceed slip force: Needed normal force F_normal > max(F_linear_axes) / \u03bc\n  - With estimated linear force ~10 N, thus F_normal > 10/0.5 = 20 N minimum grip force for safety margin\n  - Grasping force set at 25 N for control margin\n\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 3 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.5 along the surface:\n  - Forces along X (left): ~10 N negative X to reposition\n  - Forces along Y (backward): ~8 N negative Y to align\n  - Forces along Z (up): ~5 N positive Z to lift then small downward adjustment\n  - Torque about X (roll correction): ~0.5 N-m clockwise to rotate wrist parallel\n  - Torque about Y (pitch correction): ~0.5 N-m counterclockwise to adjust flexion\n  - Torque about Z (yaw): no significant torque needed\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task and based upon estimated joint resistance and required small lateral adjustment, the object in the image must exert negative force along the X-axis with magnitude 10 N.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task and based upon realignment along forearm axis, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 8 N.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task and based upon lifting relief and setting down of the wrist, the object in the image must exert positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude 5 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon rotational alignment of wrist joint, the object in the image must exert clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon rotational flexion adjustment, the object in the image must exert counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon no required yaw adjustment, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nGrasping force:  Estimated grip force range between 20 N and 30 N based on friction, mass, and safety margin, thus 25 to 25 N.\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human wrist and forearm segment of approx 3 kg mass, soft tissue and bone with moderate stiffness, robot gripper rubber pads with 0.5 static friction coefficient on skin contact.\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Small coordinated translation upward along Z, leftward along X, backward along Y, with rotational adjustments: clockwise about X, counterclockwise about Y for anatomical realignment.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [-0.02, -0.015, 0.01]  # in meters, small precise motions\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [-10, -8, 5, -0.5, 0.5, 0]  # forces in Newtons, torques in N-m\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 25\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 10.0\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]"
