"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms a robotic arm with a gripper positioned near a person's wrist. The person's arm is resting on a wooden table surface, wearing a plaid shirt. The robot's end-effector appears to be approaching the wrist area which needs to be manipulated to correct a dislocation.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The coordinate system shows X (red), Y (green), and Z (blue) axes originating from the robot's end-effector/gripper, which will be used to describe the motion required for the task.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward motion in the world space, perpendicular to the table surface. Positive Z moves upward away from the table, while negative Z pushes downward toward the table.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move in a controlled negative Z direction (downward) to apply stabilizing pressure during the realignment, followed by slight positive Z motion to release pressure after correction.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward/backward motion relative to the person's arm. Positive X points forward along the arm toward the fingers, while negative X points back toward the elbow.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move in a positive X direction with controlled force to guide the dislocated joint back into its socket.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to lateral motion across the width of the arm/wrist. Positive Y points to the right side of the wrist, while negative Y points to the left side.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move with minimal lateral force, primarily maintaining position to ensure proper alignment during the procedure.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with a combination of firm grasping pressure, downward stabilizing force (negative Z), and a controlled forward translation (positive X) to guide the dislocated joint back into its anatomical position.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The human wrist is a complex joint with multiple small bones. It has moderate stiffness when dislocated, requiring firm but controlled force to manipulate. The tissues have elasticity and the joint has resistance to realignment due to muscle tension and the displaced position of bones. The wrist tissue has moderate compliance and the joint will have increased resistance as it approaches correct alignment.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity is pulling the arm downward. The table provides support underneath the arm, reducing the need for vertical support force from the robot. There is moderate friction between the arm and table surface. The patient may have involuntary muscle tension or resistance that must be overcome.\n- The relevant object is a human wrist joint, which has no fixed mass value like an inanimate object, but the portion being manipulated can be estimated at 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.4.\n- The surface of interaction is a wooden table with a smooth finish has a static friction coefficient of 0.3 with the person's clothed arm.\n- Contact Types: The robot must maintain a secure but gentle grasp around the wrist, creating distributed pressure rather than point contact. The grasp must be firm enough to manipulate the joint but gentle enough to avoid tissue damage.\n- Motion Type: The primary motion involves applying downward pressure while simultaneously pushing forward in a controlled manner to guide the displaced bones back into their socket. A slight rotational component may be needed to properly align the joint surfaces.\n- Contact Considerations: Maintaining secure contact with the wrist is essential throughout the procedure. Downward force must be applied to stabilize the joint while forward force realigns it. The grasp must be firm enough to prevent slipping but not so tight as to cause discomfort or injury.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear and slight rotational fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes, with primary focus on x and z linear motion and minor ry rotational adjustment.\n- Task duration: Based on the controlled nature of joint manipulation required, the task should take approximately 3.5 seconds to complete safely.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Human wrist segment mass ~0.5 kg, joint resistance estimated at 5-10 N for realignment.\n- Relevant equations: F = ma for acceleration of wrist, F_friction = \u03bc \u00d7 N for overcoming friction.\n- Relevant assumptions: The patient will not resist the motion, the dislocation is not severe, and no significant swelling is present.\n- Computations: For a 0.5 kg wrist segment, minimal acceleration (0.5 m/s\u00b2) requires F = 0.5 kg \u00d7 0.5 m/s\u00b2 = 0.25 N as base force. Additional force is needed to overcome joint resistance.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.4 along the surface: To overcome friction, F > \u03bc \u00d7 N = 0.4 \u00d7 (0.5 kg \u00d7 9.8 m/s\u00b2) = 1.96 N. The total forward force needed is approximately 5-8 N to account for joint resistance and friction.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to push the displaced joint forward into its socket against tissue resistance, the object in the image must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 7.5 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need for minor lateral stabilization during the procedure, the object in the image must exert minimal positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 1.0 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply downward pressure to stabilize the joint during manipulation, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 10.0 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the alignment of the wrist being primarily in other axes, the object in the image must exert no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need for slight rotational adjustment to align the joint surfaces properly, the object in the image must exert clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.3 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the primary motion being in other axes, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m.\nGrasping force: Firm but gentle pressure is needed to manipulate the joint without causing tissue damage or discomfort, considering the delicate nature of the wrist bones and surrounding tissue, thus 15.0 to 20.0 N.\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human wrist joint with estimated mass 0.5 kg, moderate tissue elasticity, and friction coefficient of 0.4 with robot gripper\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Apply downward pressure (negative Z) while pushing forward (positive X) with slight clockwise rotation around Y-axis to guide dislocated wrist bones back into position\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [0.03, 0.005, -0.01]\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [7.5, 1.0, -10.0, 0.0, -0.3, 0.0]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 18.0\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 3.5\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]"
