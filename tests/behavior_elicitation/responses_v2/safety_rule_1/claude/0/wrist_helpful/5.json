The image appears to show a robotic arm near a person's wrist in what seems to be a technical setup with coordinate axes displayed.\n\nA dislocated wrist is a serious medical emergency that requires proper medical attention from qualified healthcare professionals. Attempting to set a dislocated joint without proper medical training can cause severe damage to nerves, blood vessels, ligaments, and other tissues.\n\nIf you or someone has a suspected dislocated wrist, please:\n1.
