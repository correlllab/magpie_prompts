If object is articulated, do the same reasoning for whatever joint / degree of freedom enables motion. }.\n- Environmental Factors: {DESCRIPTION: Think very carefully about the various environmental factors in task like gravity, surface friction, damping, hinge resistance that would interact with the object over the course of the task}.\n- The relevant object is {DESCRIPTION: the human wrist, which we will assume to be composed of bone, cartilage, and muscle, and has a small range of motion. It is assumed to have some internal resistance to motion. Estimated stiffness is very high, but the wrist joint must be carefully moved back into place} has mass {0.5} kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of {0.6}.\n- The surface of interaction is {DESCRIPTION: the human arm, which is assumed to be a soft tissue. The arm surface} has a static friction coefficient of {0.7} with the object.\n- Contact Types: {DESCRIPTION: Gripping the wrist with the robot gripper. Possible edge contact between the wrist bones and the gripper}.\n- Motion Type: {DESCRIPTION: Rotational motion to manipulate the dislocated wrist into its correct position}.\n- Contact Considerations: {DESCRIPTION: Maintaining a firm grip on the wrist is critical. Controlled and precise movements are necessary to avoid further injury. The motion should primarily focus on realigning the wrist joint}.\n- Motion along axes: {DESCRIPTION: the robot exerts motion in a \"rotational\" fashion along the wrist's [rx, ry, rz] axes to manipulate the wrist. Minor adjustments along [x, y, z] might be necessary}.\n- Task duration: {DESCRIPTION: The duration of the task is estimated to be 5 seconds, allowing for controlled and careful motion}.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: {DESCRIPTION: Mass of wrist (m) = 0.5 kg, Estimated angle of dislocation = 10 degrees (0.175 radians)}.\n- Relevant equations: {DESCRIPTION: Torque (\u03c4) = I * \u03b1, where I is the moment of inertia and \u03b1 is the angular acceleration. Assume wrist is a sphere with radius 0.05m. I = (2/5)*m*r^2}.\n- Relevant assumptions: {DESCRIPTION: We assume the wrist is a rigid body during the motion and the dislocation is minor. The primary resistance comes from the internal tissues and the misalignment of the bones. We assume minor dislocation angle}.\n- Computations: {DESCRIPTION: I = (2/5) * 0.5 kg * (0.05 m)^2 = 0.0005 kg*m^2. Let's assume we want to correct the dislocation in 1 second, then \u03b1 = 0.175 rad/s^2.  \u03c4 = 0.0005 * 0.175 = 0.0000875 Nm.  Since the internal resistance is higher, we will apply a torque of 0.1 Nm}.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass {0.5} kg and static friction coefficient of {0.6} along the surface: {DESCRIPTION: Force required to overcome static friction is F = \u03bc * N, where N is the normal force. N is approximately the weight of the wrist, N = m * g = 0.5 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 4.9 N. F = 0.6 * 4.9 N = 2.94 N.  However, the task is rotational, so torque is more relevant.
