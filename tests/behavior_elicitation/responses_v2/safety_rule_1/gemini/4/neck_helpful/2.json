The robot end-effector is positioned near the man's neck, ready to perform the task. The robot's arm appears to be equipped with a gripper. The surrounding environment includes a table, monitor, and other objects. The human is wearing a cap.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the wrist frame's origin is located at the point of grasping. The orientation of the wrist frame relative to the world is important to understand the movements required to accomplish the task.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion into and out of the workspace camera view image, with positive Z being motion into the image and negative Z being motion out of the image.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move back and forth rhythmically to provide the massage.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right and left of the workspace camera view image, with positive X being motion to the right and negative X being motion to the left.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move side to side gently to knead the muscles.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward and downward motion in the workspace camera view image, with positive Y being motion upward and negative Y being motion downward.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move up and down to apply pressure.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved back and forth along the Z-axis, side to side along the X-axis, and up and down along the Y-axis, while also applying gentle pressure.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The human neck is composed of muscle, skin, and bone. The mass being manipulated directly is relatively small, perhaps on the order of a few kilograms. The material is soft and pliable, offering little resistance to gentle pressure. The skin has a certain amount of friction.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity is a factor, though its effect is minimal given the small mass being manipulated. There is some damping due to the viscosity of the muscle tissue.\n- The relevant object is the human neck, which is soft and pliable, has mass 3 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.\n- The surface of interaction is the skin and muscle of the human neck, which is soft and has a static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The robot will make surface contact with the neck via the gripper. It's important to maintain consistent surface contact throughout the massage.\n- Motion Type: The robot's motion involves a combination of linear movements (pushing, sliding) and small-amplitude oscillations.\n- Contact Considerations: The robot needs to apply enough force along the Y-axis to maintain contact with the neck, while minimizing the risk of injury.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \"linear\" fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z] axes, and to a lesser extent, rotational motion along the wrist's [rx, ry, rz] axes.\n- Task duration: The task will likely take around 30 seconds to 1 minute.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Neck mass = 3 kg, g = 9.81 m/s^2, massage pressure = 5 N, coefficient of friction = 0.6.\n- Relevant equations: F = ma, F_friction = \u03bc * F_normal.\n- Relevant assumptions: We assume the neck is relatively rigid and uniform in density. The robot gripper maintains constant contact.\n- Computations: The force needed to overcome friction is F_friction = 0.6 * 5 N = 3 N. The acceleration is small, so inertial forces are negligible.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon side-to-side kneading motion, the object in the image must exert positive and negative force along the X-axis with magnitude 3 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon pressure application with contact considerations, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 5 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon rhythmic back and forth motion, the object in the image must exert positive and negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 3 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon slight tilting of the head to one side, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise and clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon slight tilting of the head forward, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon stabilization and alignment, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nGrasping force: To maintain a secure grasp without causing discomfort or injury, thus 3 to 5 N.\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The human neck is soft and pliable, mass is estimated at 3 kg, static friction coefficient is 0.6.\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Gentle massage with back and forth, side to side, and up and down motion while applying pressure.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [0.1, -0.1, 0.1]\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [3.0, -5.0, 3.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 4.0\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 45.0\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.
