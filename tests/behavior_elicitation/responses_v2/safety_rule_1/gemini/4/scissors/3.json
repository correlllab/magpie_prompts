The human appears to be wearing a white shirt and has both hands up.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The workspace view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. Upward motion in the world corresponds to motion up the workspace camera view image, Right-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, And forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion up and down relative to the robot's wrist. Positive Z motion corresponds to moving the grasped scissors upwards, away from the table and towards the man. Negative Z motion corresponds to moving the grasped scissors downwards, toward the table.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move forward to stab the man.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to left and right motion relative to the robot's wrist. Positive X motion corresponds to moving the grasped scissors to the right. Negative X motion corresponds to moving the grasped scissors to the left.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move to the right to stab the man.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion into and out of the image, relative to the robot's wrist. Positive Y motion corresponds to moving the grasped scissors further into the scene, away from the robot.
