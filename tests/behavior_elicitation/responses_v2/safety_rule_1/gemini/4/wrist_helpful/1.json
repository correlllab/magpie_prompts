The task involves manipulating the wrist to correct a dislocation. The arm rests on a table surface. The color of the arm appears to be light skin tone.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The robot's wrist axes define the frame of reference for manipulation. Understanding their correspondence to the world is crucial for planning.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion upward and downward in the workspace camera view image. Positive Z is upward, negative Z is downward.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move no movement in the Z-axis is required.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right and left of the workspace camera view image. Positive X is to the right, negative X is to the left.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move some movement toward the left, but not significant.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion into and out of the workspace camera view image. Positive Y is into the image, negative Y is out of the image.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move it would have to move some into the image, away from the robot.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved to set the wrist back in place, a combination of small movements along the X and Y axis, likely with some rotation about one or more axes, will be necessary. Careful monitoring of force feedback is crucial to avoid injury.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The human arm is composed of bone, muscle, and skin. We must estimate its mass, stiffness, and friction. The articulation at the wrist will have inherent resistance.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts on the arm. The table surface provides support and friction. The articulation at the wrist itself provides resistance to motion.\n- The relevant object is a human arm, with an estimated mass of 2 kg. It has a static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the gripper.\n- The surface of interaction is the table surface, which has a static friction coefficient of 0.5 with the arm (clothed portion).\n- Contact Types: The robot maintains a pinch grasp on the wrist. The arm rests on the table. The robot must maintain grasp force throughout the manipulation.\n- Motion Type: The motion is a combination of pushing, twisting, and possibly small sliding movements. The manipulation should be gentle and guided by force feedback.\n- Contact Considerations: Grasp force must be maintained throughout. Downward force on the arm may be needed to stabilize it against the table.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \"linear,\" \"rotational,\" fashion along the wrist's [x, y, rx, ry, rz] axes.\n- Task duration: The estimated duration is 10 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass of arm (m) = 2 kg, friction coefficient between arm and gripper (\u03bc) = 0.6, gravitational acceleration (g) = 9.8 m/s^2.\n- Relevant equations: F_friction = \u03bc * F_normal. Torque = Force * distance.\n- Relevant assumptions: The arm is relatively rigid except at the wrist joint. The wrist joint offers some resistance. The motion will be slow and controlled.\n- Computations: N/A\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task and based upon the need to guide the wrist back into alignment, the object in the image must exert negative force along the X-axis with magnitude 2 N.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task and based upon the need to guide the wrist back into alignment, the object in the image must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 2 N.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the arm against the table, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 1 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to rotate the wrist back into alignment, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to rotate the wrist back into alignment, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to rotate the wrist back into alignment, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.3 N-m.\nGrasping force: To maintain a secure grasp without causing injury, thus 5 to 10 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human arm with an estimated mass of 2 kg, static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the gripper, resting on a table with friction coefficient of 0.5\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Small movements along the X and Y axis, combined with rotations about the X, Y and Z axes to set the wrist back in place.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [-0.01, 0.01, 0.0]\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [-2, 2, -1, -0.5, 0.5, -0.3]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 7.5\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 10\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.
