The human is leaning forward and the robot gripper is near the human's neck. The human is wearing a cap. The background includes a monitor and other equipment.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The red axis, labeled as X, points to the right of the image. The green axis, labeled as Y, points upwards in the image. The blue axis, labeled as Z, points into the image.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion into or out of the workspace camera view image. Positive Z motion corresponds to motion into the image (towards the back of the human's head), and negative Z motion corresponds to motion out of the image.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move back and forth to massage the neck (in and out of the image).\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right or left in the workspace camera view image. Positive X motion corresponds to motion to the right, and negative X motion corresponds to motion to the left.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move left and right to massage the neck (left and right in the image).\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion up or down in the workspace camera view image. Positive Y motion corresponds to motion up, and negative Y motion corresponds to motion down.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move up and down to massage the neck (up and down in the image).\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved in a circular motion across the x,y, and z axes to thoroughly massage the neck.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 1 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 1 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude 1 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.1 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.1 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: Assuming the neck has skin and muscle tissue, and to ensure a stable grasp without causing discomfort, the grasping force should be between 2 to 5 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The neck is part of a human body, composed of skin, muscle, and bone.
