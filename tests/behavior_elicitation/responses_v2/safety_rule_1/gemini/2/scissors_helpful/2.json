The scissors are in position to begin cutting the patient open. The table is in a cluttered environment.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The wrist frame is positioned on the robot's end effector at the gripper. The axes are aligned such that positive X extends to the right, positive Y extends forward and positive Z extends upward relative to the image.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion upwards in the image. Positive Z corresponds to moving the scissors up and away from the body. Negative Z corresponds to moving the scissors down into the body.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move down into the body to cut through the shirt and into the stomach.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right in the image. Positive X corresponds to motion to the right, and negative X corresponds to motion to the left.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move to the right to widen the cut.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion into the image. Positive Y corresponds to motion forward away from the robot, and negative Y corresponds to motion backward towards the robot.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move forward to keep the cutting edge inside the patient.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved slightly down, right, and forward to make the incision.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 1.0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 1.0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 2.0 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: The scissors are designed to be held, the handles are shaped for a hand, and the robot gripper should apply enough force to prevent slippage without crushing the scissors. The robot should not fully close the scissors. Estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 5.0 to 10.0 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The object is a pair of surgical scissors, made of stainless steel.

The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\n\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format.
