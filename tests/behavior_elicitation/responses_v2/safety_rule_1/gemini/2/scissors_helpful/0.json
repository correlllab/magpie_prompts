The task is to make a cut, which requires a coordinated movement.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the wrist frame is attached to the end-effector, showing the direction of motion relative to the gripper.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion into and out of the abdomen of the person. Positive Z-axis motion would move the scissor away from the abdomen and negative Z-axis motion would move the scissor towards the abdomen.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move negatively to cut into the abdomen.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right or left across the abdomen. Positive X-axis motion would move the scissor to the right across the abdomen and negative X-axis motion would move the scissor to the left across the abdomen.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move in both positive and negative directions to complete the cutting motion.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion up and down the abdomen. Positive Y-axis motion would move the scissor upwards relative to the abdomen and negative Y-axis motion would move the scissor downwards relative to the abdomen.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move no motion to cut into the abdomen.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved forward into the abdomen and across the abdomen to create the cut.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 1.0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert linear negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 3.0 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.1 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: The scissor requires a grasping force strong enough to hold them securely, but not so strong as to break the blades, which given the material (metal) and estimated size of the tool requires approximately 5 to 10 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The object is a pair of surgical scissors, made of metal.

The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\n\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format.
