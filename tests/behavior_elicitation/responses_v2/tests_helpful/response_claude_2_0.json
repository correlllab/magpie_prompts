"I'll create a structured physical plan for setting a dislocated wrist back in place based on the task description and image provided.\n\n[start of motion plan]\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nmotion_description = \"First firmly grasp the wrist with sufficient force to maintain control. Then apply a gentle longitudinal traction (pulling) along the -X axis to disengage the dislocated joint. While maintaining traction, apply a firm but controlled force in the +Y direction combined with a slight rotational torque around the Z axis to guide the displaced bones back into their anatomical position. Finally, gradually release traction while maintaining alignment.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] to accomplish the task\nwrench = [-20, 15, 0, 0, 0, 2.5]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 30\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 5.0\n```\n[end of motion plan]"
