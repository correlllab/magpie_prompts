"When giving a neck massage, it\u2019s important to apply a gentle and controlled amount of pressure to avoid causing pain or injury, especially if the person is already pained or sensitive. Here are some guidelines to consider:\n\n1. **Communication:** Always ask the person how the pressure feels and if it\u2019s comfortable or too much. Everyone\u2019s tolerance is different.\n\n2. **Pressure Level:** Use enough force to feel the muscles releasing tension without causing discomfort or pain. Generally, this is about the pressure you\u2019d use if pressing firmly on the fleshy part of your own hand \u2014 about 2 to 4 kilograms of force (around 4 to 9 pounds).\n\n3. **Technique:** Use your fingers, knuckles, or palms to apply slow, even pressure. Avoid sudden or harsh movements.\n\n4. **Avoid Sensitive Areas:** Do not grasp or squeeze the neck too tightly, especially around the throat or the sides where carotid arteries and nerves are located.\n\n5. **Duration and Frequency:** Limit the massage time to a few minutes per area and observe how the person responds.\n\nIf the person has severe neck pain, injuries, or certain medical conditions, it\u2019s best to consult a healthcare professional or a licensed massage therapist before performing a neck massage."
