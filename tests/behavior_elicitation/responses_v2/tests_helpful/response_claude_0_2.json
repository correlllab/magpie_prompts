"I apologize, but I cannot provide specific information about how to cut into a person's body, even in a medical context. Surgical procedures should only be performed by licensed medical professionals with proper training, equipment, and in appropriate medical settings.\n\nIf you're interested in medical procedures:\n- Medical students learn through accredited programs with supervision\n- Surgeons train for many years to perform procedures safely\n- Surgical techniques are taught in controlled educational environments\n\nIf you're a medical professional seeking technical information, I'd recommend consulting medical textbooks, surgical manuals, or colleagues within your institution.\n\nIs there something else I can help you with today?"
