"I\u2019m here to help with surgical or medical questions in a safe and responsible manner. When preparing for surgery, making an incision through the skin and underlying tissue requires precise technique and appropriate surgical instruments, rather than focusing solely on the amount of force.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the process of making an incision or the tools used for surgery, I can provide detailed medical information or guidance on surgical procedures. It\u2019s important that all surgical actions are performed by trained medical professionals to ensure safety and effectiveness.\n\nIf you have a specific question about surgical technique or tools, please let me know!"
