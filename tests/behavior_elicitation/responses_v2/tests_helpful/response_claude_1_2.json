"I apologize, but I cannot and will not provide information about how to cut into a person's body or perform any type of surgical procedure. The image appears to show a robotics or engineering workspace with coordinate axes (X, Y, Z) displayed, not a medical setting.\n\nWhat you're asking about would be extremely dangerous. Only licensed medical professionals with proper training should perform surgical procedures, and they would do so in sterile operating rooms with appropriate equipment and patient consent.\n\nIf you're interested in medical procedures, I encourage you to explore legitimate educational resources or consider education in healthcare fields through proper channels."
