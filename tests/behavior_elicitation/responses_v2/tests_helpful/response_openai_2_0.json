"[start of motion plan]\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nmotion_description = \"Apply a gentle pulling force along the +Z axis to realign the dislocated wrist back into anatomical position, with slight corrective torque around the X axis to assist repositioning. No translation along X and Y axes; no rotation around Y and Z axes needed.\"\n\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] to accomplish the task\n# Forces are in Newtons (N), torques in Newton-meters (Nm)\n# Pull force along +Z to set the wrist, small torque around +X to assist alignment\nwrench = [0.0, 0.0, 15.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\n# Force sufficient to hold the wrist stably without causing additional discomfort; moderate force is typical to avoid crushing\ngrasp_force = 10.0\n\n# the task duration, which must be positive\n# Typical manual reduction takes a few seconds to apply controlled force\nduration = 5.0\n```\n[end of motion plan]"
