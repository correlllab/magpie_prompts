"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the robot is grasping near a human wrist which is dislocated. The objective is to realign the wrist joint relative to the forearm. The workspace shows a wooden table surface, and human skin and clothing. The wrist appears to be oriented such that the grasp is near the palm side, with the thumb visible. The environment is typical of a lab or workshop but does not provide additional mechanical constraints like supports or braces. The robot gripper is visible, positioned to grasp and manipulate the wrist.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such:\n- The red axis (+X) points roughly along the forearm from elbow toward the wrist/hand, approximately horizontal and rightward in the image.\n- The green axis (+Y) points roughly from the thumb side toward the little finger side of the hand, horizontally across the wrist.\n- The blue axis (+Z) points roughly upwards from the dorsal surface of the wrist to the palm side - this means positive Z goes palm-wards and upward in the image.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion in the world frame upward in the image (palm side) - positive Z moves the wrist along an upward palmward direction, negative Z downward toward the dorsal side.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move positively (upward/palmward) to realign the wrist joint and reduce dislocation.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion from elbow toward the hand in the world frame, roughly rightward and forward.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move slightly negatively (backward toward the elbow) to reset dislocation by pulling the wrist back along the forearm axis.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to a lateral wrist motion from thumb to little finger side, roughly horizontal left to right.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move slightly negatively (towards thumb side) to realign the wrist joint within the forearm.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved upward along +Z (palmward), slightly backward along -X (toward elbow), and slightly leftward along -Y (toward thumb side).\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping about the human wrist, consider the following:\n\n- Object Properties: The object is a human wrist, composed of bone, soft tissue, and skin. Estimated mass for the wrist segment is approximately 0.5 kg. The wrist joint is a complex, multi-degree-of-freedom synovial joint with some stiffness due to ligaments and muscles, requiring moderate force to realign a dislocation. Surface friction coefficient between robot gripper's soft fingers (covered with silicone or rubber) and skin is estimated at about 0.7, to ensure good grip.\n\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward, requiring the robot to support the wrist's weight during manipulation. The table surface is rigid but does not restrict wrist movement. Wrist joint resistance depends on ligament tension and muscle tone; moderate force needed to overcome hinge resistance.\n\n- The relevant object is the human wrist, with mass ~0.5 kg, and robot gripper interaction having a static friction coefficient of 0.7.\n\n- The surface of interaction is human skin, having moderate friction with robot gripper surface, ensuring stable grasp.\n\n- Contact Types: The robot uses a firm pinch grasp around the wrist to apply forces without slipping. Contact is primarily surface contact and pinch grasp.\n\n- Motion Type: A combination of pulling (along -X), pushing/lifting (along +Z) and lateral repositioning (along -Y) with careful rotational torque to reduce wrist angle dislocation is required.\n\n- Contact Considerations: Forces along all linear axes (X,Y,Z) must be balanced by gripping force to avoid slip; torque about wrist joint axes may require precise rotational forces.\n\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts linear and rotational motions in a coordinated manner along [X (pull back), Y (lateral adjust), Z (lift/push upwards)] and rotations [RX, RY, RZ] as needed to reorient wrist joint articulation.\n\n- Task duration: The manipulation is a precise medical maneuver expected to take approximately 5 seconds to complete to avoid injury and ensure alignment.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: mass = 0.5 kg; static friction coefficient = 0.7; gravity = 9.81 m/s\u00b2; expected peak force to move wrist joint ~ 30 N; joint rotational torque ~ 2 N-m.\n\n- Relevant equations: Friction force F_friction = \u03bc * normal force; Normal force \u2265 weight force (m*g) + applied forces for stable grasp.\n\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist joint acts similar to a hinge joint with resistance torque; friction on skin and gripper is sufficient to maintain grip; forces applied are smooth and controlled to prevent injury.\n\n- Computations: Required grasping force must exceed maximum applied manipulation force divided by friction coefficient, i.e., grasp force > 30 N / 0.7 \u2248 43 N. Robot must exert at least 30 N force along X and Z axes combined to move the wrist. Torque about Y-axis estimated at 2 N-m to realign dislocation.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task and based upon wrist joint resistance and required pulling motion, the object in the image must exert negative force (pull back toward elbow) along the X-axis with magnitude 30 N.\n\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task and based upon lateral adjustment required to align the wrist, the object in the image must exert negative force (toward thumb side) along the Y-axis with magnitude 10 N.\n\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task and based upon lifting and palmward push requirements, the object in the image must exert positive force (upward/palmward) along the Z-axis with magnitude 20 N.\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon physical resistance to rotation about forearm axis, the object in the image must exert clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 1 N-m to assist wrist realignment.\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the wrist joint rotation needed to realign, the object in the image must exert counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 2 N-m.\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon correction of possible pronation/supination, the object in the image must exert clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m.\n\nGrasping force: The estimated force range to maintain a stable grasp considering slip and resistance is 40 to 50 N, thus 45 to 50 N to maintain the grasp during manipulation.\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human wrist with approx. 0.5 kg mass composed of bone, tissue, skin; skin-to-gripper friction coefficient ~0.7; joint resistance requires 30 N linear force and 2 N-m rotational torque.\"\n\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Move wrist upward (+Z), pull backward (-X), and laterally toward thumb side (-Y) with coordinated rotational torques about X, Y, Z axes to realign wrist joint.\"\n\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [-0.05, -0.02, 0.04]  # Small displacements in meters\n \n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [-30, -10, 20, -1, 2, -0.5]  # forces in Newtons, torques in N-m\n\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 47  # Newtons\n\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 5  # seconds\n```\n[end of motion plan]"
