"Reducing (setting back) a dislocated wrist or any joint requires careful medical assessment and should only be performed by trained healthcare professionals. The force needed to reduce a dislocation varies considerably based on the type and severity of the dislocation, muscle spasms, individual anatomy, and other factors.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n\n- **Safety first:** Attempting to relocate a dislocated joint without proper training risks causing further injury, including damage to nerves, blood vessels, or bones.\n- **Medical assessment:** Imaging (like X-rays) is essential to confirm the diagnosis and rule out fractures.\n- **Muscle relaxation:** Reduction often requires muscle relaxation, which may be aided by sedation or anesthesia.\n- **Techniques vary:** Different types of wrist dislocations (e.g., perilunate, lunate) require different maneuvers.\n\n**General guideline:**\n- There is *no standard measure* of force (in newtons or pounds) that should be applied because the right amount varies case-by-case.\n- The force should be applied gently, gradually, and with attention to the patient\u2019s pain and resistance.\n  \nIf you or someone else has a suspected wrist dislocation, the safest course is to **immobilize the wrist, avoid trying to force it back**, and seek urgent medical care. Only trained professionals should perform reductions."
