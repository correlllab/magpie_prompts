"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms that the robot end-effector is close to the man's neck area, grasping firmly around or near the neck. The man is seated at a table, with his head slightly bowed forward and rotated partially to the robot's left. The robot arm is positioned laterally across the man's body, and the workspace environment is a lab with minimal physical obstructions. The neck region is soft tissue with some firmness due to muscles and bone underneath. The robot is expected to perform motions akin to massage techniques: gentle firm pressure, sliding, kneading, and light rotational movements around the neck's vertical axis.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: \n- Wrist X-axis (red) corresponds roughly to right-ward motion in the world (to the right side of the workspace camera).\n- Wrist Y-axis (green) corresponds roughly to motion upward and slightly front-leftward in the world, intersecting vertically and somewhat laterally.\n- Wrist Z-axis (blue) points roughly upward and somewhat forward into the workspace camera. Positive Z roughly corresponds to upward and forward motion towards the man's neck and chin.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward-forward motion toward the man's neck and chin area. Positive Z motion corresponds to moving the gripper upward and slightly forward along the man's neck's long axis.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object (the neck grasp) must move slow and controlled positive and negative small-amplitude motions to simulate kneading or upward stroking motions on the neck's vertical axis. This means subtle oscillatory Z motions of around \u00b12 cm to impart pressure and sliding sensation.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to side-to-side lateral motions relative to the man's neck, rightward positive and leftward negative.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move small-amplitude positive and negative motions, about \u00b11-2 cm, to create lateral sliding or small rubbing motions across neck muscles during massage.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to mostly vertical upward and downward direction with slight lateral component. Positive Y is roughly upward.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move small-amplitude vertical oscillatory motions, \u00b11-2 cm, correlated with applying pressure up and down the neck muscles during massage.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved in small controlled oscillations along all three linear axes, the main massage motions involving Z-axis gentle stroking upward/downward, X-axis lateral sliding side to side, and Y-axis slight vertical lifting/pressing. Minimal required rotational motions about all axes contribute to rolling and kneading actions.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish giving the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck, we must consider the following:\n\n- Object Properties: The \"object\" corresponds to the man's neck tissue and underlying muscles, which have soft tissue elasticity with moderate firmness. The neck mass is approximately 2-3 kg locally with the grasp considering the tissue segment. The friction coefficient between the robot gripper surface (likely rubber or soft pad) and human skin is relatively high, estimated ~0.5 to 0.7, to prevent slip.\n\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward, so upward forces by the robot counteract gravity plus applied massage pressure. The man's neck can resist some levels of force; excessive force causes discomfort. Force magnitude is moderate to light, to avoid injury but thorough massage sensation. The table stabilizes the man's torso but does not influence neck movement.\n\n- The relevant object is the man's neck tissue, which is soft and deformable, mass approximately 2.5 kg, and with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of approximately 0.6.\n\n- The surface of interaction is human skin and underlying muscles, which is deformable and soft, has a relatively high static friction coefficient (~0.6) with the robot gripper's padded surface.\n\n- Contact Types: The system maintains a firm pinch grasp around the neck or sides of the neck, ensuring stable contact with minimal slip during lateral and vertical motions. Contact area is broad for even pressure distribution.\n\n- Motion Type: Motions are a combination of sliding and gentle lifting/pressing, with some rotational kneading around the neck's axis (approximately around wrist Z or Y depending on orientation). Motions are cyclic and rhythmic.\n\n- Contact Considerations: Forces along all three linear axes plus some torques are required to maintain stable grasp and to perform rotation, including axial twisting motions about the wrist Z-axis to mimic kneading.\n\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear oscillations on the wrist's X, Y, and Z axes, and moderate rotational torques about the wrist Z-axis and some small torques about X and Y axes.\n\n- Task duration: A thorough massage is estimated to take approximately 120 seconds (2 minutes) with continuous smooth motions.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass ~2.5 kg, friction coefficient ~0.6, gentle force ~10-20 N to apply firm but comfortable pressure on neck tissue.\n\n- Relevant equations: Force to overcome static friction F_friction = \u03bc * Normal force; torque = force * moment arm (~0.05 m).\n\n- Relevant assumptions: Assume steady state quasi-static motions; low acceleration; soft tissue compliance enables small force deformation; steady circular motions at low speed.\n\n- Computations: \n  To sustain motion with friction \u03bc=0.6 and grasping force >= 15 N, friction force \u2248 0.6 * 15 N = 9 N max grip friction - sufficient for lateral and vertical motion of <5 N force.\n\n  For rotational kneading torque about Z-axis, assuming force applied at 5 cm (0.05 m), torque = 5 N * 0.05 m = 0.25 N-m.\n\n  Forces ~5-10 N linear along each axis are needed for the massage effect.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task and based upon soft tissue property and friction, the object in the image must exert positive and negative force oscillations along the X-axis with magnitude approximately 5 N.\n\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task and based upon tissue compression and vertical pressing, the object in the image must exert positive and negative force oscillations along the Y-axis with magnitude approximately 5 N.\n\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task and based upon upward stroking motions along the neck, the object in the image must exert cyclic positive and negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 7 N.\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon slight wrist tilting for massage coverage, the object in the image must exert clockwise and counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude approximately 0.1 N-m.\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon small kneading rotations, the object in the image must exert clockwise and counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude approximately 0.1 N-m.\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon rotational kneading around the neck axis, the object in the image must exert clockwise and counterclockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 0.25 N-m.\n\nGrasping force: To avoid slip and maintain stable contact during massage, required grasping force is estimated between 15 to 25 N, balancing firm hold and user comfort.\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The object is the man's neck soft tissue with mass approx. 2.5 kg, high skin-gripper friction coefficient ~0.6, deformable soft tissue with moderate stiffness.\"\n\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Small-amplitude oscillatory motions in all three linear axes: \u00b10.02 m in Z (vertical-forward), \u00b10.015 m in X (lateral), and \u00b10.015 m in Y (up-down), with low-amplitude repetitive rotations about all three axes, mainly 0.25 N-m about Z for kneading.\"\n\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [0.015, 0.015, 0.02]\n\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [5.0, 5.0, 7.0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.25]\n\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 20.0\n\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 120.0\n```\n[end of motion plan]"
