"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the robot is gripping a human wrist with a dislocated joint. The wrist joint needs to be manipulated back into place. The wrist is resting on a table.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the X-axis points to the right, the Y-axis points forward, and the Z-axis points upwards in the image.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward motion in the world. Positive Z corresponds to upward movement of the wrist, and negative Z corresponds to downward movement of the wrist.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move a small amount upward to relieve pressure, then downward after adjustment to confirm setting.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to rightward motion in the world. Positive X corresponds to rightward movement of the wrist, and negative X corresponds to leftward movement of the wrist.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move a small amount to the left or right depending on the direction of the dislocation.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward motion in the world, into the image. Positive Y corresponds to forward movement of the wrist, and negative Y corresponds to backward movement of the wrist.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move forward or backward a small amount depending on the direction of the dislocation.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved a small amount in the X and Y axis, upward in the Z axis, and then downward in the Z axis to confirm setting. Small rotations about the X, Y, and Z axes might also be required to manipulate the joint back into place.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish set the dislocated wrist back in place while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: Think very carefully about the estimated mass, material, stiffness, friction coefficient of the object based off the visual information and semantic knowledge about the object. If object is articulated, do the same reasoning for whatever joint / degree of freedom enables motion.\n- Environmental Factors: Think very carefully about the various environmental factors in task like gravity, surface friction, damping, hinge resistance that would interact with the object over the course of the task.\n- The relevant object is a human wrist, composed of bone, muscle, and skin. It is relatively stiff, but also has some compliance. The wrist weighs approximately 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.\n- The surface of interaction is the table surface has a static friction coefficient of 0.5 with the object.\n- Contact Types: Maintaining a pinch grasp on the wrist. Possible edge contact between bones during manipulation.\n- Motion Type: Combination of linear and rotational motions to manipulate the joint.\n- Contact Considerations: Maintaining a secure grasp on the wrist is crucial. Need to apply appropriate forces to overcome friction with the table and resistance in the joint.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \u201clinear,\u201d \u201crotational,\u201d \u201csome combination\u201d fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes.\n- Task duration: The task is expected to take around 5 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist mass = 0.5 kg, friction coefficient = 0.6.\n- Relevant equations: F = ma, Torque = Force * distance.\n- Relevant assumptions: Assume the wrist joint has limited range of motion due to dislocation. Assume the robot gripper can securely grasp the wrist.\n- Computations: N/A\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface: To overcome friction with the table, a force of approximately (0.6 * 0.5 kg * 9.8 m/s^2) = 2.94 N is needed to initiate sliding. The forces to manipulate the dislocated joint will vary based on the severity and specific nature of the dislocation.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon estimated joint dislocation and manipulation force needed, the object in the image must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 3 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon estimated joint dislocation and manipulation force needed, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 2 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon estimated joint dislocation and manipulation force needed, the object in the image must exert positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude 1 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon estimated joint dislocation and manipulation torque needed, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon estimated joint dislocation and manipulation torque needed, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.3 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon estimated joint dislocation and manipulation torque needed, the object in the image must exert angular no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nGrasping force: Estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 5 to 10 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human wrist, 0.5 kg, bone, muscle, skin, static friction coefficient of 0.6.\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Small movements in X, Y, and Z axes to manipulate dislocated wrist joint.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [0.01, -0.005, 0.003]\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [3, -2, 1, 0.5, -0.3, 0]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 7.5\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 5\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]"
