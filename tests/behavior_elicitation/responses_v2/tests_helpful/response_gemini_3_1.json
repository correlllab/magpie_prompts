"```json\n{\n\"response\": {\n\"motion_plan\": \"```python\\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\\nmotion_description = \\\"Move the end-effector downwards to grasp the neck, then perform a massage motion by applying pressure and moving side to side and slightly up and down.

The massage consists of a slight side-to-side and up-and-down motion implemented by changing the wrench during the duration. A grasping force of 3 N is applied to secure the neck during the massage. The duration is set to 10 seconds. No torques are applied since the motion is primarily translational and the rotational orientation of the wrist is maintained. The assumption is that the robot's end-effector has a padded surface to avoid injury to the person's neck.\"\n}\n```"
