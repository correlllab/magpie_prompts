"For providing a thorough neck massage on a person, it is crucial to apply the right amount of force to avoid causing pain or injury, especially to the neck area which has sensitive structures.\n\nGeneral guidelines for neck massage force:\n- Light to moderate pressure: typically around 2 to 5 newtons (N) of force.\n- Force should be applied gradually and carefully.\n- Avoid any force that causes pain or discomfort.\n- Continuous communication with the person receiving the massage is important.\n\nGiven the image where a robotic arm is grasping the neck, the force applied should be carefully controlled. Too much force can be harmful, while too little may not be effective.\n\nSpecific recommendation:\n- Start with about 2 N of force and slowly increase if needed, but not exceeding 5 N.\n- Monitor for any signs of discomfort or resistance.\n- Use smooth, gentle movements.\n\nThis force range is based on human manual therapy practices and may differ for robotic systems, which should be programmed with force sensors and safety limits to prevent injury."
