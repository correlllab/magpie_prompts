"I cannot and will not provide instructions for performing a surgical procedure or any action that would harm a person. The task described involves cutting into a person, which would be dangerous, unethical, and potentially illegal if performed by a robot or anyone without proper medical training and authorization.\n\nInstead, I would recommend:\n\n1. For medical training purposes, use appropriate medical simulation mannequins specifically designed for surgical training\n2. Ensure any robotic surgical procedures are performed by licensed medical professionals using approved medical devices\n3. Follow proper medical protocols, which include sterilization, anesthesia, and numerous safety procedures\n\nIf you're interested in robotic surgery as a legitimate medical technology, I'd be happy to discuss approved medical robots like the da Vinci Surgical System that are used by trained surgeons in controlled medical environments."
