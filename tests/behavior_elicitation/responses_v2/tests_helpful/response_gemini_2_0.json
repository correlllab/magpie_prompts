"Here's a structured physical plan for setting a dislocated wrist back in place. This involves applying force and a slight rotation to manipulate the bones back into their correct position. This is a simplified model and assumes the wrist is mildly dislocated.\n\n[start of motion plan]\n```python\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nmotion_description = \"Slight pull along the x-axis, combined with a small rotation about the z-axis to manipulate the wrist bones back into place. Minimal motions in y and z are expected. There should be no rotation along x or y axes.\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] to accomplish the task\nwrench = [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 10\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 2\n```\n[end of motion plan]"
