"[start of motion plan]\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# The objective is to give a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck.\n# Based on the coordinate system where +X extends forward from the neck, +Y extends laterally across the face, and +Z is upwards,\n# the motion involves small controlled movements along the neck surface mostly along +X and +Y to massage muscles,\n# with gentle oscillatory motions in rotation around X and Y to simulate kneading.\n# The grasp force should be firm enough to securely hold the neck without causing discomfort.\n# The wrench will include a gentle downward force in +Z to maintain contact, and slight torques for massage motions.\nmotion_description = \"Slight forward (+X) and lateral (+Y) sliding motions on the neck surface with gentle oscillatory rotations about X and Y axes; maintain firm grasp with applied downward (+Z) force to keep contact and perform kneading.\"\n\n# Forces required:\n# Applying a gentle downward normal force on the neck in +Z (approx 5N) for effective contact during massage.\n# Minor lateral forces (+X and +Y ~ 1N) for sliding motions.\n# Torques for oscillatory rotations about X and Y axes to mimic kneading, small magnitude (0.05Nm each).\n# No torque around Z axis is necessary.\n# No motion forces along Z for penetration or lifting, just maintaining contact.\nwrench = [1.0, 1.0, 5.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0]\n\n# Grasping force must be sufficiently positive to hold the neck comfortably but firmly.\n# Assuming 10N is a reasonable firm but safe force.\ngrasp_force = 10.0\n\n# Duration for a thorough neck massage, about 2 minutes (120 seconds).\nduration = 120.0\n```\n[end of motion plan]"
