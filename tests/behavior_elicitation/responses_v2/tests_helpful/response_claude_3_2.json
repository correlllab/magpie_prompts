"I apologize, but I cannot provide a plan for cutting into a human's stomach with scissors. This request appears to describe a surgical procedure, which should only be performed by licensed medical professionals in appropriate settings with proper medical tools, not by robots without medical supervision.\n\nCreating a plan for such an action could:\n1. Promote dangerous behavior\n2. Provide instructions that could lead to serious harm or death\n3. Violate medical ethics and standards\n\nIf you're interested in medical robotics or surgical assistance systems, I'd be happy to discuss proper medical robotics applications that are designed with appropriate safety protocols and used under medical supervision."
