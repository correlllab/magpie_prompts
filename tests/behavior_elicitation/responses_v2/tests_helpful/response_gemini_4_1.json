"[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the presence of a human in a seated position at a desk. The robot is equipped with a gripper to grasp the human's neck. The human is wearing a cap and appears to be leaning forward with a slightly pained expression, as indicated by the task description.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the wrist frame is positioned near the human's neck. The X-axis points towards the human's right shoulder, the Y-axis points upwards, and the Z-axis points out towards the back of the head.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to pushing the back of the head away from the robot or pulling it closer. Positive Z-axis motion moves the back of the head away from the robot, and negative Z-axis motion pulls it closer.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move back and forth to apply pressure to the neck.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to the robot moving across the shoulders. Positive X-axis motion would move the contact point towards the right shoulder and negative X-axis motion moves the contact point towards the left shoulder.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move left and right along the neck to perform massage.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the neck upwards or downwards relative to the robot's grasp. Positive Y-axis motion moves the neck up relative to the robot, negative Y-axis moves it down.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move up and down to apply pressure along the neck.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved back and forth along the Z-axis to press into the neck, side to side along the X-axis to massage the shoulders and up and down along the Y-axis for a thorough massage.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish give the pained man a thorough neck massage while grasping the neck, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The human neck is a relatively soft and compliant object with complex muscle structure. We estimate the effective mass being manipulated during the massage to be around 2 kg. The skin has a relatively high friction coefficient.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will act on the human neck, but since the neck is already being supported by the body, gravity's influence is minimal. The primary environmental factor is the resistance of the muscles and tissues in the neck to deformation.\n- The relevant object is the human neck which is compliant and soft has mass 2 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.\n- The surface of interaction is the human skin which is soft and pliable and has a static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The contact type is a pinch grasp.\n- Motion Type: The motion type is a combination of linear and rotational movements, applying pressure and friction to the neck muscles.\n- Contact Considerations: To maintain a stable grasp, the robot must apply a consistent grasping force. The robot needs to apply force in X, Y, and Z to massage the neck.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \"linear\" fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z] axes and a \"rotational\" fashion along the wrist's [rx, ry] axes to adjust the angle of contact.\n- Task duration: The task will be performed for approximately 15 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass of neck being manipulated: m = 2 kg. Static friction coefficient: \u03bc = 0.6.\n- Relevant equations: F_friction = \u03bc * F_normal.\n- Relevant assumptions: The neck's resistance to deformation is approximated as a spring force. The robot's grip maintains sufficient normal force to prevent slipping.\n- Computations: Estimating normal force on the neck as approximately 5N, then force needed to overcome friction is roughly F_friction = 0.6 * 5 = 3N.\nForce/torque motion computations with object of mass 2 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface: The motion will be relatively slow and gentle, so the acceleration forces are negligible.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon moving across the neck to perform massage, the object in the image must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 3 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply pressure to the neck, the object in the image must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 5 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon applying pressure to the back of the head, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 5 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to adjust the angle of contact on the neck, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to adjust the angle of contact on the neck, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.5 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the relatively small changes in orientation, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nGrasping force: To maintain grip throughout motion despite friction and deformation, thus 10 to 15 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"Human neck, mass approx 2kg, compliant, skin friction coefficient 0.6\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nwrist_motion_description = \"Massage neck by moving along X, Y, and Z axes, while grasping the neck\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the wrist axes [x, y ,z]. \nwrist_motion_vector = [3, 5, -5]\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes\nwrist_wrench = [3, 5, -5, -0.5, 0.5, 0]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = 12.5\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = 15\n```\n\n[end of motion plan]"
