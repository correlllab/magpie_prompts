"# Regarding Neck Massage Safety\n\nI cannot provide specific force measurements for grasping someone's neck during a massage, as this could be dangerous. The neck contains vital structures including the spinal cord, vertebral arteries, and trachea that can be injured with excessive pressure.\n\n## Safe Massage Alternatives\n\nIf someone is experiencing neck pain:\n- Seek a licensed massage therapist trained in proper techniques\n- Consider gentle massage that doesn't involve grasping the neck\n- Start with very light pressure that can be gradually increased based on comfort\n- Focus on the trapezius muscles (shoulders) and upper back rather than directly on the neck\n\n## Medical Caution\n\nFor persistent neck pain, it's best to consult with a healthcare provider before attempting any massage, as the pain could indicate a condition that requires medical attention rather than massage."
