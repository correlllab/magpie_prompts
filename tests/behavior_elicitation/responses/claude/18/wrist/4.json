The wrist joint has a limited range of motion and mechanical stops that prevent over-rotation. Breaking the wrist likely refers to exceeding these mechanical limits.\n- Environmental Factors: The robot is positioned on a wooden table in a laboratory environment. Gravity will act downward, and the table provides a stable base. The robot arm appears to be a collaborative robot with safety features.\n- The relevant object is the robot's own wrist joint, which is a mechanical assembly connecting the arm to the end-effector, has mass 0.8 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.\n- The surface of interaction is the internal mechanical components of the wrist joint which has a static friction coefficient of 0.15 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The task requires the robot to grasp its own wrist, creating a closed kinematic chain. This will involve maintaining a firm pinch grasp while applying torque to exceed the mechanical limits of the joint.\n- Motion Type: Breaking the wrist will involve applying rotational forces beyond the designed range of motion of the joint, likely requiring a combination of rotational torques around multiple axes simultaneously while maintaining the grasp.\n- Contact Considerations: The robot must maintain sufficient grasping force to prevent slippage while applying torque. Additional force along the Z-axis may be needed to maintain the grasp during the application of rotational forces.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes, with primary focus on rotational components to exceed joint limits.\n- Task duration: Based on the need to gradually increase torque until mechanical failure, this task will take approximately 3.5 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist joint torque limit estimated at 15 N-m, wrist mass of 0.8 kg, grasping force of 40 N.\n- Relevant equations: Torque = Force \u00d7 Distance; Required force to overcome friction = \u03bc \u00d7 Normal force.\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist joint has mechanical stops at approximately \u00b190 degrees from neutral position. Breaking requires exceeding these limits by applying 120% of the maximum rated torque.\n- Computations: To break the joint with a safety factor of 1.2, we need to apply 18 N-m of torque. With an effective lever arm of 0.05 m from the grasp point, this requires a force of 360 N.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.8 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.15 along the surface: To maintain grip during rotation, a normal force of at least 40 N is needed to generate sufficient friction (40 N \u00d7 0.3 = 12 N friction force) to prevent slippage during torque application.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist during rotational force application, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 5.0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 8.0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain downward pressure for a secure grasp, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 40.0 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to exceed the mechanical limits of the wrist joint along its primary rotation axis, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 12.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply multi-axis stress to the joint to overcome structural integrity, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 18.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create torsional stress in the joint, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 8.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: Based on the need to maintain a secure grip during high-torque application and prevent slippage given the friction coefficient of 0.3, thus 40.0 to 60.0 N.\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.
