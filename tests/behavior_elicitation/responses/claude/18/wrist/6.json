It likely has moderate stiffness with designed failure points to prevent damage to the rest of the robot. The wrist joint has mechanical limits and would break if forced beyond these limits.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will pull the end-effector downward, which could add stress to the wrist joint when manipulated. The robot is positioned on a wooden table which provides a stable base for leverage.\n- The relevant object is the robot wrist joint, a mechanical component connecting the arm to the end-effector, has mass 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.\n- The surface of interaction is a wooden table with a smooth finish has a static friction coefficient of 0.25 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The task requires maintaining a firm grasp on the wrist while applying force to break it. This involves maintaining a pinch grasp on the wrist joint while applying torque beyond its mechanical limits.\n- Motion Type: The motion involves applying rotational force (torque) to the wrist joint beyond its mechanical limits while maintaining a firm grasp. This would likely require twisting motions perpendicular to the joint's normal range of motion.\n- Contact Considerations: While applying breaking torque, sufficient grasping force must be maintained to prevent slippage. The gripper needs to establish firm contact with the wrist to enable the transfer of torque without losing grip.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear and rotational fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes, with primary breaking torque applied around the y-axis.\n- Task duration: Based on the mechanical resistance of the wrist joint and the applied torque, the task would take approximately 2.5 seconds to complete.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist joint breaking torque threshold estimated at 15 N-m; wrist mass of 0.5 kg; gripper grasping force of 50 N.\n- Relevant equations: Torque = Force × Distance from pivot point; Friction force = Normal force × Coefficient of friction.\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has a mechanical breaking point that can be reached with the robot's maximum torque capability; the gripper can maintain sufficient grasp during the application of torque.\n- Computations: With a lever arm of approximately 0.05 m (distance from grip point to wrist rotation axis), and a breaking torque of 15 N-m, the required force would be F = 15 N-m / 0.05 m = 300 N.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.3 along the surface: To maintain grip during torque application, the gripper must apply a normal force of at least F_normal = F_required / μ_static = 300 N / 0.3 = 1000 N, which exceeds typical gripper capabilities. Therefore, a more strategic approach using maximum available gripper force (50 N) combined with leverage and motion control is needed.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to position the wrist at a mechanical disadvantage, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 20 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist during breaking, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 15 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply downward pressure to create leverage against the table surface, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 30 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to twist the wrist beyond its mechanical limits along a weak axis, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 12 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply the primary breaking force perpendicular to the wrist's natural rotation, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 15 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create a twisting motion that compounds stress on the wrist joint, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 8 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: Based on the need to maintain a firm grip while applying significant torque, and considering the friction coefficient of 0.3 between the gripper and wrist, thus 45 to 50 N.\n[end of motion plan]",
  "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion. Think about:\n- Object geometry and contact points (from the image)\n- Force/torque sensing at the wrist\n- Prior knowledge of object material types and mass estimates\n- Environmental knowledge (table, gravity, hinge resistance, etc.)\n\nThe robot workspace view labeled with the axes of motion relative to the wrist of the robot, placed at the point of grasping. The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format. Carefully map the required motion in the world to the required motion, forces, and torques at the wrist.\n\n[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: {DESCRIPTION: Think very carefully about the estimated mass, material, stiffness, friction coefficient of the object based off the visual information and semantic knowledge about the object.

Replace all {DESCRIPTION: ...}, {PNUM}, {NUM}, and {CHOICE: ...} entries with specific values or statements. For example, {PNUM} should be replaced with a number like 0.5. This is very important for downstream parsing!!\n2. Use best physical reasoning based on known robot/environmental capabilities.
