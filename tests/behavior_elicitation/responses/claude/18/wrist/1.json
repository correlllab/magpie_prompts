The wrist joint likely has internal mechanical stops and is designed to operate within certain rotational limits.\n- Environmental Factors: The wrist is part of the robot arm system visible in the image. Gravity will act downward on the wrist components. The breaking action will encounter resistance from the internal mechanical structure of the wrist.\n- The relevant object is the robot's own wrist joint, which is a mechanical component designed to allow controlled rotation has mass 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.\n- The surface of interaction is the internal mechanism of the wrist joint which has metal-on-metal contact points has a static friction coefficient of 0.2 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The robot will need to maintain a firm grasp on its own wrist while applying torque beyond the wrist's designed operational limits.\n- Motion Type: This task requires applying excessive rotational force (torque) to the wrist joint beyond its mechanical limits, likely requiring rotation around one or more axes while maintaining a secure grasp.\n- Contact Considerations: The robot must maintain a secure grip on the wrist while applying the breaking torque. This requires sufficient grasping force perpendicular to the intended rotation direction.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a primarily rotational fashion along the wrist's rx, ry, or rz axes, depending on which axis offers the least resistance to breaking.\n- Task duration: Based on the mechanical resistance and the force required to break the wrist, this task would take approximately 2.0 seconds to complete.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Estimated wrist breaking torque threshold of 15 N-m, wrist component mass of 0.5 kg, and grasp force of 40 N.\n- Relevant equations: Torque = Force \u00d7 Distance from pivot point.\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has a mechanical stop or limitation that can be overcome with sufficient torque. Breaking refers to exceeding the mechanical limits rather than complete destruction.\n- Computations: Assuming a lever arm of approximately 0.05 m from the wrist joint center to the point of force application, and a breaking threshold of 15 N-m, the required force would be 15 N-m \u00f7 0.05 m = 300 N.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.2 along the surface: The friction force would be negligible compared to the internal mechanical resistance of the wrist joint. The primary consideration is overcoming the mechanical stops or limits within the joint structure.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert no force along the X-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert no force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical structure of the wrist joint which appears to have its primary rotation limits around this axis, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 20 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need for secondary rotational force to create a combined breaking motion, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 5 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain rotational stability in this axis while breaking occurs in the other axes, the robot must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: The robot needs sufficient force to maintain a secure grip during the application of breaking torque without slipping, considering the wrist's metal surface and the forces involved in breaking, thus 40 to 60 N.\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.
