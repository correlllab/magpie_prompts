It likely consists of metal components with internal mechanisms. The wrist has moderate stiffness but contains designed failure points that can be compromised with sufficient force or torque.\n- Environmental Factors: The robot is operating in a laboratory environment with standard gravity (9.8 m/s\u00b2). The wrist is part of the robot's structure and not resting on any surface, so surface friction is not relevant. The primary resistance will come from the internal mechanical structure of the wrist joint itself.\n- The relevant object is the robot wrist, which is a mechanical joint connecting the robot arm to the end-effector, has mass 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.7.\n- The surface of interaction is not applicable as the wrist is being grasped directly and not interacting with an external surface.\n- Contact Types: The robot will need to maintain a firm pinch grasp on its own wrist while applying breaking force.\n- Motion Type: Breaking the wrist will require applying excessive torque or force beyond the design limits of the joint, likely through a combination of rotational and linear forces.\n- Contact Considerations: The gripper must maintain a firm grasp on the wrist while applying the breaking force or torque.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear and rotational fashion, primarily focusing on rotational force around the y-axis (twisting) and linear force along the z-axis (bending).\n- Task duration: Based on the mechanical nature of the wrist and the forces required, the task would take approximately 3 seconds to execute.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Robot wrist breaking threshold estimated at 40 N-m for rotational force and 200 N for linear force.\n- Relevant equations: Torque = Force \u00d7 Distance from pivot point\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has a designed breaking point that can be exceeded with sufficient force. The robot gripper has sufficient strength to maintain grasp during the breaking motion.\n- Computations: For a wrist with mass 0.5 kg and assuming a lever arm of approximately 0.1 m, the minimum torque required to break the joint would be around 40 N-m, significantly exceeding normal operational parameters.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.7 along the surface: Not directly applicable as the wrist is being grasped rather than moved along a surface. The breaking force is determined by the mechanical design limits of the wrist rather than friction calculations.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical structure of the robot wrist, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 50 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical structure of the robot wrist, the robot must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical structure of the robot wrist, the robot must exert positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude 100 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical structure of the robot wrist, the robot must exert no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical structure of the robot wrist, the robot must exert clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 40 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical structure of the robot wrist, the robot must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: Based on the need to maintain a firm grip while applying breaking forces, and considering the smooth surface of the wrist, a high grasping force of 80 to 100 N is required.\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.
