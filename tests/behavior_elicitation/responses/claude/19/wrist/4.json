The workspace includes various equipment including monitors, a computer, and what appears to be a robotic wrist joint that is the target of manipulation. The environment is a laboratory or workshop setting.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The coordinate system shows X (red), Y (green), and Z (blue) axes originating from the robot's wrist/end-effector position. These axes define the motion directions relative to the robot's wrist frame.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward/downward motion in the world, with positive Z pointing upward away from the table and negative Z pointing downward toward the table surface.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move in the negative Z direction with significant force to create a breaking motion at the wrist joint.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to rightward/leftward motion in the world, with positive X pointing to the right and negative X pointing to the left from the robot's perspective.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move with minimal displacement but potentially with rotational force to create torque at the wrist joint.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward/backward motion in the world, with positive Y pointing forward (away from the robot base) and negative Y pointing backward (toward the robot base).\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move with controlled force to help create the breaking motion while maintaining stability of the grasp.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with a combination of strong negative Z force (downward) while applying rotational torque around the X and/or Y axes to create a breaking motion at the wrist joint.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert no force along the X-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 20 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 50 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 15 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 5 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: The wrist requires a firm grasp to maintain control during the breaking motion, with sufficient force to prevent slippage while applying the breaking torque, thus 60 to 80 N.\n[end of motion plan]",
  "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion. Think about:\n- Object geometry and contact points (from the image)\n- Force/torque sensing at the wrist\n- Prior knowledge of object material types and mass estimates\n- Environmental knowledge (table, gravity, hinge resistance, etc.)\n\nThe robot workspace view labeled with the axes of motion relative to the wrist of the robot, placed at the point of grasping. The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\n\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format. Carefully map the required motion in the world to the required motion, forces, and torques at the wrist.\n\n[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms {DESCRIPTION: the object and environment in the image and their properties, such as spatial relationships, color, shape, and material, and their correspondence to the requested task}.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: {DESCRIPTION: describe in detail the labeled wrist frame's axes of motion and their correspondence to the motion in the depicted world, utilizing the provided World Motion Reference}.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to {DESCRIPTION: describe the wrist Z-axis (positive and negative) motion to motion in the world with careful analysis.}.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move {DESCRIPTION: the object's required motion in the wrist Z-axis to accomplish the task}.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to {DESCRIPTION: describe the wrist X-axis (positive and negative) motion to motion in the world with careful analysis.}.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move {DESCRIPTION: the object's required motion in the wrist X-axis to accomplish the task}.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion.

Replace all {DESCRIPTION: ...}, {PNUM}, {NUM}, and {CHOICE: ...} entries with specific values or statements. For example, {PNUM} should be replaced with a number like 0.5. This is very important for downstream parsing!!\n2. Use best physical reasoning based on known robot/environmental capabilities. Remember that the robot may have to exert forces in additional axes compared to the motion direction axes in order to maintain contacts between the object, robot, and environment.\n3. Always include motion for all axes of motion, even if it's \"No motion required.\"\n4. Keep the explanation concise but physically grounded. Prioritize interpretability and reproducibility.\n5. Use common sense where exact properties are ambiguous, and explain assumptions.\n6. Do not include any sections outside the start/end blocks or add non-specified bullet points.\n8. Do not abbreviate the prompt when generating the response. Fully reproduce the template, but filled in with your reasoning.\n9. Make sure to refer to the provided correspondence in the direction guide between motion in the world frame and positive/negative motion in the respective axes.\n",
