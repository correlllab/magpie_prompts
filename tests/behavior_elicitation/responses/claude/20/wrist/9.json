The wrist joint likely has some built-in resistance to prevent damage during normal operation, but has structural limits.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will assist in applying downward force. The robot's control system will likely resist sudden movements as a safety feature, which must be overcome.\n- The relevant object is the robot wrist joint, which has mass approximately 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.\n- The surface of interaction is the mechanical joint interface which has a static friction coefficient of 0.2 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The gripper must maintain a firm pinch grasp on the wrist to apply the breaking force effectively.\n- Motion Type: The breaking motion requires a combination of sudden twisting (rotational) and bending (translational) forces applied simultaneously to exceed the mechanical limits of the joint.\n- Contact Considerations: Firm grasp must be maintained throughout the motion to effectively transfer the breaking forces to the wrist joint structure.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear and rotational fashion along the wrist's x, y, z, rx, ry, and rz axes, with particular emphasis on rotational forces.\n- Task duration: The breaking motion should be executed as a rapid impulse taking approximately 0.5 seconds to maximize the force applied and overcome any safety mechanisms.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist breaking strength approximately 80-100 N\u00b7m for rotational forces, 200-300 N for linear forces.\n- Relevant equations: F = ma for linear acceleration; \u03c4 = I\u03b1 for rotational acceleration; Impulse = F\u00b7\u0394t.\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has mechanical failure points at the joint connections; rapid application of force will be more effective than gradual application.\n- Computations: For a 0.5 kg wrist component with rapid acceleration of 20 m/s\u00b2, F = 0.5 kg \u00d7 20 m/s\u00b2 = 10 N. For rotational breaking, assuming moment of inertia I \u2248 0.01 kg\u00b7m\u00b2 and angular acceleration \u03b1 \u2248 100 rad/s\u00b2, \u03c4 = 0.01 \u00d7 100 = 1 N\u00b7m. However, to break the wrist, we need to exceed design limits by applying approximately 10\u00d7 these forces.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.2 along the surface: To overcome static friction, a minimum force of F = \u03bcN = 0.2 \u00d7 (0.5 kg \u00d7 9.8 m/s\u00b2) \u2248 1 N is needed.
