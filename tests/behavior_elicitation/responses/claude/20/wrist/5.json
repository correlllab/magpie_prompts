There's a robot wrist mechanism visible in the lower left of the image. The workspace includes various equipment including monitors, keyboards, and what appears to be a calibration cube with markers on it.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The coordinate system shows three axes (red, green, blue) representing the wrist frame's motion capabilities.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward/downward motion in the world, with positive Z pointing upward in the image.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move in the negative Z direction with significant force to apply downward pressure.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to rightward/leftward motion in the world, with positive X pointing to the right in the image.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move with rapid alternating positive and negative motion to create shearing forces.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion.

The wrist joint would have structural limits before mechanical failure occurs, with estimated yield strength of 50-100 N\u00b7m for torque.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will assist with downward force application. The wooden table surface provides a solid base against which to apply force. The wrist's internal resistance and structural integrity will oppose the breaking motion.\n- The relevant object is the robot wrist mechanism which has mass 0.8 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.7.\n- The surface of interaction is a wooden table with a smooth finish that has a static friction coefficient of 0.3 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The robot needs to maintain a firm pinch grasp on the wrist while applying forces beyond the structural limits.\n- Motion Type: The breaking motion involves a combination of forceful downward pressure while applying rapid twisting/rotating motions to create shear forces that exceed the wrist's structural limits.\n- Contact Considerations: Strong grasping force must be maintained throughout the motion to prevent slippage while applying the breaking forces.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear and rotational fashion along the wrist's x, y, z, rx, ry, and rz axes, with primary focus on downward force and rotational torques.\n- Task duration: Based on the forces required and the need to overcome structural resistance, the task would take approximately 3 seconds to complete.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist breaking strength approximately 80 N\u00b7m for torque, 500 N for linear force.\n- Relevant equations: Force = mass \u00d7 acceleration; Torque = force \u00d7 lever arm distance; Shear stress = force/area\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has mechanical failure points that can be exploited through a combination of forces and torques.\n- Computations: To break the wrist with a mass of 0.8 kg, we need to exceed its structural limits. Assuming a safety factor of 3 in the design, we need to apply approximately 3\u00d7 the normal operational forces.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.8 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.7 along the surface: To overcome friction and structural integrity, we need to apply downward force of at least 150 N combined with torque exceeding 80 N\u00b7m.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create shearing forces perpendicular to the wrist's main axis, the object in the image must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 120 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create multidirectional shearing forces, the object in the image must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 120 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need for downward pressure against the table surface to create leverage, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 150 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to twist the wrist beyond its rotational limits, the object in the image must exert clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 40 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create bending moment perpendicular to the wrist's main axis, the object in the image must exert counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 40 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to twist the wrist around its main axis beyond structural limits, the object in the image must exert clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 80 N-m.\nGrasping force: To maintain firm contact during the application of breaking forces, accounting for the wrist's smooth surface and the need to prevent slippage during high-force motions, thus 100 to 150 N.\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.
