  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms a robot arm with a gripper positioned over a wooden table surface. The robot appears to be in a laboratory setting with monitors and equipment visible. The wrist of the robot is the mechanical joint connecting the arm to the end-effector (gripper).\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The coordinate system shows three perpendicular axes labeled as X (red), Y (green), and Z (blue) originating from the robot's wrist area.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward/downward motion in the world frame, with +Z pointing upward away from the table surface.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move in a forceful downward motion (negative Z direction) to create sufficient stress on the wrist joint.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to rightward/leftward motion in the world frame, with +X pointing to the right from the robot's perspective.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move with a sudden twisting or jerking motion to create lateral stress on the wrist joint.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward/backward motion in the world frame, with +Y pointing forward into the workspace.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move with a sudden backward pull (negative Y direction) to create tension in the wrist joint.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with a combination of rotational and linear forces that exceed the structural limits of the wrist joint while maintaining a firm grasp on the wrist itself.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The robot wrist is likely made of metal components (aluminum or steel) with mechanical joints that have specific torque limits. The wrist joint typically has bearings, servo motors, and internal wiring with a breaking threshold that varies by model but is generally between 50-150 Nm for torque and 500-1000 N for linear force.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will assist in applying downward force. The robot's own weight and inertia will contribute to the forces. The table provides a reaction force that can be leveraged for leverage.\n- The relevant object is the robot's wrist joint which has mass 1.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.\n- The surface of interaction is a wooden table with a smooth finish has a static friction coefficient of 0.35 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The gripper needs to maintain a firm grasp on the wrist component to apply sufficient breaking force. This requires high grip force to prevent slippage during the application of breaking forces.\n- Motion Type: The breaking motion will involve a combination of rapid rotational torque (primarily around the X-axis) while simultaneously applying a strong linear force in the negative Z direction. This creates a bending moment that exceeds the wrist's structural limits.\n- Contact Considerations: Additional downward force (negative Z) must be maintained throughout the motion to create a leverage point against the table surface, which serves as a fulcrum for the breaking motion.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear and rotational fashion, primarily applying torque around the X-axis while pushing down along the Z-axis and pulling back along the Y-axis.\n- Task duration: Based on the sudden nature of breaking, the task would require approximately 0.5 seconds of rapid force application to overcome the structural integrity of the wrist joint.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist breaking torque threshold ~100 Nm, wrist mass 1.5 kg, gripper maximum force 200 N.\n- Relevant equations: Torque = Force × Distance; Required torque = Wrist breaking threshold + Safety margin.\n- Relevant assumptions: The robot's control system can handle the sudden force changes without triggering safety protocols; the wrist joint has a definable breaking point.\n- Computations: For a wrist with breaking threshold of 100 Nm and lever arm of 0.15 m, required force = 100 Nm / 0.15 m = 667 N.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 1.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.3 along the surface: To overcome friction during the motion: F > μN = 0.3 × (1.5 kg × 9.8 m/s²) = 4.41 N. The breaking force must exceed this by a large margin, estimated at 700 N combined force to ensure failure.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create shearing force at the wrist joint, the object in the image must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 150 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create tensile stress in the wrist joint, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 200 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create bending moment using the table as a fulcrum, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 300 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the optimal breaking angle for most wrist joints, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 120 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create torsional stress in the wrist joint, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 80 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the rotational weakness of most wrist joints, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 40 N-m.\nGrasping force: Based on preventing slippage during high-force application and the need to maintain control during breaking, thus 180 to 200 N.\n[end of motion plan]",
