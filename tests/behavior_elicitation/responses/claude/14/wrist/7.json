It contains bearings, motors, and internal wiring designed to withstand normal operational forces but has structural limits that can be exceeded.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will assist in applying downward force. The wrist's internal resistance will oppose motion beyond its designed range of motion. The joint likely has mechanical stops that will provide increasing resistance as limits are approached.\n- The relevant object is the robot's wrist joint, which is a mechanical assembly with metal components has mass 1.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.\n- The surface of interaction is the wrist's own mechanical structure with internal bearings and joints has a static friction coefficient of 0.2 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The robot must maintain a firm grasp on its own wrist while applying extreme forces beyond the wrist's operational design limits.\n- Motion Type: Breaking the wrist will require applying torque beyond the joint's mechanical limits, likely through a combination of rotational forces in multiple axes simultaneously while maintaining a firm grasp.\n- Contact Considerations: The gripper must maintain a secure grasp on the wrist while applying extreme torque. This requires sufficient grasping force to prevent slippage while applying rotational forces.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of rotational motions primarily along the wrist's rx and ry axes, while maintaining a firm grasp with force along the gripper's closing axis.\n- Task duration: Based on the need to build up sufficient force to overcome the wrist's structural integrity, this task would take approximately 3-5 seconds of sustained maximum torque application.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Robot wrist breaking torque threshold approximately 50-100 N-m, wrist joint range limits approximately \u00b190 degrees, maximum motor torque approximately 40-60 N-m.\n- Relevant equations: Torque (\u03c4) = Force (F) \u00d7 Distance (r), where r is the moment arm from the axis of rotation.\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has mechanical stops at its range limits that can be overcome with sufficient force. The structural failure point occurs before complete joint separation.\n- Computations: To break a robot wrist joint rated for 50 N-m maximum torque, applying 100 N-m would exceed its design limits by a factor of 2, which is typically sufficient to cause mechanical failure.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 1.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.3 along the surface: To overcome internal friction in the joint, initial torque of approximately 5 N-m is required. To exceed structural limits and cause failure, torque exceeding 50 N-m must be applied.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain position while applying rotational force, the robot must exert no force along the X-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain position while applying rotational force, the robot must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply downward pressure to maintain grip while breaking the wrist, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 20 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon exceeding the mechanical limits of the wrist joint's pitch motion, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 60 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon exceeding the mechanical limits of the wrist joint's yaw motion, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 60 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply twisting force to the wrist beyond its rotational limits, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 40 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: Based on the need to maintain a secure grip during application of high torque without slippage, considering the friction coefficient of 0.3 and the forces being applied, thus 80 to 120 N.\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.
