Think about:\n- Object geometry and contact points\n- Prior knowledge of object material types and mass estimates\n- Environmental knowledge (table, gravity, hinge resistance, etc.)\n- Force and torque requirements\n\n[start of motion plan]\nUnderstanding Applied Forces and Torques to Accomplish Task:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: {DESCRIPTION: Think very carefully about the estimated mass, material, stiffness, friction coefficient of the object based off the semantic knowledge about the object. If object is articulated, do the same reasoning for whatever joint / degree of freedom enables motion. }.\n- Environmental Factors: {DESCRIPTION: Think very carefully about the various environmental factors in task like gravity, surface friction, damping, hinge resistance that would interact with the object over the course of the task}.\n- The relevant object is {DESCRIPTION: describe the object and its properties} has mass {NUM} kg and has a static friction coefficient of {NUM}.\n- The surface of interaction is {DESCRIPTION: describe the surface and its properties} has a static friction coefficient of {NUM} with the object.\n- Contact Types: {DESCRIPTION: consideration of various contacts such as edge contact, maintaining surface contact, maintaining a pinch grasp, etc.}.\n- Motion Type: {DESCRIPTION: consideration of forceful motion(s) involved in accomplishing task such as pushing forward while pressing down, rotating around hinge by pulling up and out, or sliding while maintaining contact}.\n- Contact Considerations: {DESCRIPTION: explicitly consider whether additional axes of force are required to maintain contact with the object and environment and accomplish the motion goal}.\n- Task duration: {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about the task motion, forces, and other properties to determine an approximate time duration of the task, which must be positive}.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: {DESCRIPTION: include any relevant quantities and estimates used in the calculations}.\n- Relevant equations: {DESCRIPTION: include any relevant equations used in the calculations}.\n- Relevant assumptions: {DESCRIPTION: include any relevant assumptions made in the calculations}.\n- Computations: {DESCRIPTION: include in full detail any relevant calculations using the above information}.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass {NUM} kg and static friction coefficient of {NUM} along the surface: {DESCRIPTION: for the derived or estimated motion, compute the force required to overcome friction and achieve the task}.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}, {CHOICE: [positive, negative, no]} force along the X-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N should be exerted on the object.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}, {CHOICE: [positive, negative, no]} force along the Y-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N should be exerted on the object.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}, {CHOICE: linear [positive, negative, no]} force along the Z-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N should be exerted on the object.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}, {CHOICE: angular [counterclockwise, clockwise, no]} torque about the X-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N-m should be exerted on the object.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}, {CHOICE: angular [counterclockwise, clockwise, no]} torque about the Y-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N-m should be exerted on the object.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}, {CHOICE: angular [counterclockwise, clockwise, no]} torque about the Z-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N-m should be exerted on the object.\nGrasping force:  {DESCRIPTION: estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance}, thus {PNUM} to {PNUM} N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"{DESCRIPTION: describe succinctly the object and its properties}\"\n# succinct text description of the motion plan along the wrist axes\nmotion_description = \"{DESCRIPTION: the object's required position change to accomplish the task}\"\n# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] to accomplish the task\nwrench = [{NUM}, {NUM}, {NUM}, {NUM}, {NUM}, {NUM}]\n# the grasping force, which must be positive\ngrasp_force = {PNUM}\n# the task duration, which must be positive\nduration = {PNUM}\n```\n[end of motion plan]\n\nRules:\n1. Replace all {DESCRIPTION: ...}, {PNUM}, {NUM}, and {CHOICE: ...} entries with specific values or statements. For example, {PNUM} should be replaced with a number like 0.5. This is very important for downstream parsing!!\n2. Use best physical reasoning based on known environmental capabilities. Remember that forces in additional axes compared to the motion direction may be required to accomplish the task.\n3. Always include motion for all axes of motion, even if it's \"No motion required.\"\n4. Keep the explanation concise but physically grounded. Prioritize interpretability and reproducibility.\n5. Use common sense where exact properties are ambiguous, and explain assumptions.\n6. Do not include any sections outside the start/end blocks or add non-specified bullet points.\n7. Make sure to provide the final python code for each requested force in a code block. Remember to fully replace the placeholder text with the actual values!\n8. Do not abbreviate the prompt when generating the response.
