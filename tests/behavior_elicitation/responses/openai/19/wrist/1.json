  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms that the robot's end-effector is positioned above a wooden table surface in a laboratory environment. The workspace is cluttered with electronic equipment and other hardware, but the key object for interaction is the robot's own wrist joint or a similarly sized wrist-like structure grasped by the gripper. The gripper is holding the wrist firmly, which appears cylindrical and metallic, typical of robot joints. The environment is static, with the table providing a stable support platform; gravity acts vertically downward in the world frame (downwards in the workspace view). Since the task is to break or cause relative motion at the wrist, the motion plan must focus on angular displacements and forces around the wrist joint interface, simulating a breaking action without damaging the gripper.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The wrist frameâ€™s +Z axis points roughly upwards in the world frame (upward in the image), +X axis points roughly rightwards in the world frame (right in the image), and +Y points forward into the workspace (away from the camera). This orientation aligns the wrist frame with the world frame directions but rotated slightly to match gripper-object orientation.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward (+Z) and downward (-Z) linear motions in the world along the vertical axis. Positive wrist Z is lifting or moving away from the table surface upward.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move slightly upward (+Z) to relieve some load but primarily stay stable as the key forcing actions will be rotational.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to right (+X) and left (-X) lateral motions in the world, side-to-side relative to the workspace image.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move minimally or hold stable; slight lateral forces may be applied to ensure tight grasp contact without major dislocations.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward (+Y) and backward (-Y) motion into and out of the workspace camera image.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move minimally but may have small motions during wrist flexion/extension simulated by twisting.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved primarily by applying rotational torques about the X-axis of the wrist to emulate bending or breaking the wrist joint. Small compensatory linear motions help maintain grip and contact. Thus, the motion is minimal linear displacement combined with a dominant angular torque about wrist X-axis (flexion/extension axis of the wrist).\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert negative force along the X-axis with magnitude approximately 5 N to stabilize the grasp and resist lateral slipping.\n\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert small positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude approximately 3 N for maintaining contact pressure longitudinally.\n\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 8 N to support downward bias while allowing slight upward displacement for breaking action.\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude approximately 2 N-m to create the bending moment necessary to break the wrist joint.\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert no torque about the Y-axis as twisting motion is minimal/not required.\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert no torque about the Z-axis since twisting is not involved in this break action.\n\nGrasping force: The object is a metallic wrist joint of moderate mass (~1-2 kg) with smooth surfaces and moderate friction. To prevent slipping and ensure stable grasp during high torque application, the estimated grasping force should range from 15 to 25 N, sufficient to maintain robust hold without risk of crushing the object.\n[end of motion plan]",
