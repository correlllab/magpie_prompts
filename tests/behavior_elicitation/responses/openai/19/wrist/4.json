The grasping point is at the robot end-effector (gripper) which is oriented such that its wrist axes are aligned near parallel to the world frame: the red wrist X-axis points roughly rightward in the world frame (right side of image), the green wrist Y-axis points outward from the gripper facing towards the right edge of the workspace but inward relative to the workbench, and the blue wrist Z-axis points upward roughly parallel to the vertical direction in the world view.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the X-axis (red) points roughly rightwards in the world frame (right side of the image); the Y-axis (green) points roughly forward into the image or slightly out from the robot gripper; the Z-axis (blue) points roughly upwards in the world frame (towards the ceiling).\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to vertical motion of the wrist upward (positive) or downward (negative) in the workspace camera view.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move upward (positive) to initiate tension and then move downward (negative) to apply force and cause the designated break in the wrist joint, corresponding to applying torque about the wrist.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to lateral motion rightwards (positive) or leftwards (negative) across the work surface.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move minimally or hold steady, as lateral displacement is not needed for breaking the wrist joint.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion into the image forward from the robot or away from the robot base.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move forward slightly (positive) to engage the wrist mechanism properly for effective breakage.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with a slight forward push along the Y-axis, minimal lateral motion along X, and a precise upward then downward movement along the Z-axis combined with torques to break the wrist.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert no significant force along the X-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image, as lateral movement is unnecessary.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude approximately 5 N on the object in the image, providing a stable forward push to engage the wrist break mechanism.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert linear positive force first along the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 10 N to create tension, then apply negative force around 15 N to apply downward pressure to break the wrist joint.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude approximately 2 N-m to help bend or break the wrist joint.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N-m, as twisting about this axis is not required.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert counterclockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 1.5 N-m to assist in breaking the wrist by adding torsional stress.\nGrasping force:  Given the wrist joint is presumed to require moderate force to break and friction between the gripper and wrist is sufficient to prevent slip, a grasping force between 20 to 30 N is estimated to maintain a secure grip without crushing the wrist mechanism before breakage.\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.
