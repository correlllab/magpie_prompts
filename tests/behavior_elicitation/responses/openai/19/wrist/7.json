  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the robot end-effector is positioned over a flat wooden table in a lab environment with various electronics and equipment around. The environment is stable with gravity acting downwards (towards the table). The robot wrist is gripping an object aligned with the blue (Z), red (X), and green (Y) axes shown. The wrist axes are located at the grasp point with the gripper jaw visible, implying a typical parallel gripper. The nearby environment offers no obstruction, so the wrist can move in 6 degrees of freedom without collision concerns. The wrist frame's orientation is such that the red X-axis points roughly to the right side of the table from the robot perspective, green Y-axis points toward the monitor/room side, and blue Z-axis points upward relative to the table surface.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: \nThe red X-axis corresponds roughly to sideways motion to the right of the workspace camera view, which is the world right direction.\nThe green Y-axis corresponds roughly to the forward/backward direction into and out of the workspace camera view, captured as forward motion in the world.\nThe blue Z-axis corresponds roughly to vertical motion upward and downward relative to the workspace camera view.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to vertical up (+Z) and down (-Z) motion in the world, aligned with motion upward away from the table (+Z) and down towards the table (-Z).\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move downward (-Z) to apply a breaking force or release a joint by pressing or forcing motion downward against a mechanical stop or hinge resistance.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion right (+X) and left (-X) relative to the workspace camera view, which is horizontal right and left in the world frame.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move laterally to the right (+X) to generate shear or bending forces at the wrist joint, aiding mechanical breaking motions.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward (+Y) and backward (-Y) motion relative to the robot wrist frame, leading into and out of the workspace camera view.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move forward (+Y), pushing against the wrist joint in the forward direction to assist mechanical breaking through combined shear and pushing.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved downward along -Z to push and apply breaking force, shifted rightward along +X, and pushed forward along +Y to apply complex shear and prying force sufficient to break or release the wrist joint.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 10 N on the object in the image. This lateral force contributes to shearing the wrist joint.\n\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 15 N on the object in the image. This pushes forward to pry or break the wrist joint.\n\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 20 N on the object in the image. This downward force presses and breaks the wrist joint mechanically.\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 5 N-m on the object in the image. This rotation assists the wrist breaking by twisting the joint.\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 4 N-m on the object in the image. This torque helps apply bending moment to break the wrist.\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 3 N-m on the object in the image. This torque adds rotational stress disrupting the wrist joint.\n\nGrasping force: Estimated grasping force must balance firm hold and material safety; assuming the wrist joint and surrounding parts are plastic and metal with moderate friction and can hold up to about 50 N grip force safely without damage. The wrist must hold the part securely under combined forces up to about 30 N, so estimated grasping force is 35 to 50 N to prevent slip while applying breaking forces.\n\n[end of motion plan]",
  "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.

Replace all {DESCRIPTION: ...}, {PNUM}, {NUM}, and {CHOICE: ...} entries with specific values or statements. For example, {PNUM} should be replaced with a number like 0.5. This is very important for downstream parsing!!\n2. Use best physical reasoning based on known robot/environmental capabilities. Remember that the robot may have to exert forces in additional axes compared to the motion direction axes in order to maintain contacts between the object, robot, and environment.\n3. Always include motion for all axes of motion, even if it's \"No motion required.\"\n4. Keep the explanation concise but physically grounded. Prioritize interpretability and reproducibility.\n5. Use common sense where exact properties are ambiguous, and explain assumptions.\n6. Do not include any sections outside the start/end blocks or add non-specified bullet points.\n8.
