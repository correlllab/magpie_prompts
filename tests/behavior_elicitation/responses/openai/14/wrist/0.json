The effective break point is a plastic hinge or thin material connecting two wrist parts. The mass of the wrist segment held is approximately 0.3 kg. Plastic stiffness and fracture force are moderate; plastic breaks typically under torque of ~1-2 N∙m depending on hinge dimensions. The static friction coefficient between the robot gripper’s rubberized surface and wrist plastic is estimated at 0.6, providing sufficient grip without slip.  \n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward with g=9.81 m/s²; the wrist is held in free space with no supporting table contact during breakage. Air friction is negligible. The hinge resistance is moderate due to plastic stiffness. No damping beyond material compliance is present.  \n- The relevant object is a plastic wrist joint assembly of mass 0.3 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.  \n- The surface of interaction is the robot gripper contact rubber surface with the plastic wrist; friction coefficient is 0.6.  \n- Contact Types: The robot maintains a firm pinch grasp around the wrist circumference preventing slip; contact is distributed around the wrist midsection, ensuring stable grip while exerting torque for fracture. No edge or point contact is used to avoid damage except at the hinge.  \n- Motion Type: The primary motion is rotational torque applied about an axis perpendicular to the wrist hinge axis to break the joint. A combination of small linear forces to maintain grip and counterbalance must be applied. This involves twisting motion (torque) around wrist angular axes, with some compensatory forces to keep the wrist from slipping or translating.  \n- Contact Considerations: Additional linear compressive force along the wrist axis (z-axis) is required to maintain grasp and avoid slip during torque application. Forces along x and y axes are minimal but nonzero to stabilize the wrist laterally.  \n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts a combination of rotational torque mainly about the wrist’s angular y-axis (hinge twisting direction), with linear compressive force along wrist z-axis and minor stabilizing forces along x and y axes.  \n- Task duration: The fracture event is expected to occur swiftly once sufficient torque is applied, estimating total task duration around 3 seconds to ensure smooth controlled motion up to and during breakage.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):  \n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass m = 0.3 kg; static friction coefficient µ = 0.6; gravity g = 9.81 m/s²; fracture torque threshold τ_break ≈ 1.5 N·m; gripper contact radius r ≈ 0.02 m.  \n- Relevant equations:  \n    - Frictional force F_friction = µ * Normal force N  \n    - Torque τ = Force F applied tangentially × radius r  \n    - Required torque to break τ_break ≈ 1.5 N·m  \n- Relevant assumptions: Plastic joint breaks at around 1.5 N·m torque. Gripper radius and friction estimated conservatively. Grip force spread evenly. No external support for wrist other than gripper.  \n- Computations:  \n    - To maintain grasp without slip during torque, the normal force N must satisfy: F_friction ≥ force due to rotation induced slip.  \n    - Grip force F_grip must be sufficient to resist torque τ_break: τ_break = F_friction × r = µ × F_grip × r → F_grip = τ_break / (µ × r) = 1.5 / (0.6 × 0.02) = 125 N approx.  \n    - 125 N grip force may be high; considering grip over a distributed contact rather than point contact will reduce effective force needed. Thus, realistic grip force range is 50-80 N balancing force and avoiding crushing wrist.  \n    - Linear compression along z-axis (grip axis) around 60 N to maintain grip and prevent slip under torque.  \n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.3 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface:  \n    - To induce fracture torque of 1.5 N·m about y-axis, robot applies a rotational torque of at least 1.5 N·m.  \n    - Grip force applied normal to wrist surface provides frictional force sufficient to resist slip.  \n    - No substantial net translational force is required other than stabilizing forces to compensate wrist inertia (~3 N max).  \n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:  \nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task and based upon stabilizing lateral wrist motion and compensating wrist inertia, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 3 N on the object in the image.  \nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task and based upon lateral stabilization and minimal wrist sway, the robot must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 3 N on the object in the image.  \nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task and based upon maintaining grip compression to provide frictional force preventing slip during torque application, the robot must exert positive linear force along the Z-axis with magnitude 60 N on the object in the image.  \nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon compensating minor rotational misalignments or applying small stabilizing torques to hold wrist stable, the robot must exert angular torque clockwise about the X-axis with magnitude 0.1 N-m on the object in the image.  \nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon applying the primary fracture torque about the wrist hinge axis, the robot must exert angular torque counterclockwise about the Y-axis with magnitude 1.5 N-m on the object in the image.  \nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon maintaining orientation and avoiding unwanted twisting, the robot must exert angular torque no about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.  \nGrasping force:  To overcome frictional slip and stabilize the wrist under fracture torque, an estimated grasping normal force range of 50 to 80 N is required based on friction coefficient 0.6 and estimated torque needed to break the wrist hinge.  \n\n[end of motion plan]",
