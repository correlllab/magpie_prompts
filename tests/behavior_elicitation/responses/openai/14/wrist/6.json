  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The wrist joint resembles a small mechanical hinge with moderate stiffness designed to support rotational loads. The mass of the wrist segment is likely around 0.5 kg. The material is likely a rigid plastic or light metal alloy with moderate structural rigidity but can fail under excessive torque. The friction coefficient between the robot’s gripper and the wrist surface is estimated to be 0.6, enabling a stable grasp without slip.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward with a force of approximately 5 N on the wrist piece. Ambient conditions include contact with the robot gripper and possibly some reaction force through the robot’s arm. The hinge resistance to rotation is moderate, requiring a torque that surpasses internal hinge stiffness to break the joint. There are no stable surfaces directly supporting the wrist piece besides the gripper.\n- The relevant object is a robot wrist joint segment which is a small articulated piece with an estimated mass of 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.\n- The surface of interaction is the robot gripper’s rubberized fingertips, which have a static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the wrist surface.\n- Contact Types: The robot establishes a firm, pinch grasp on the wrist segment with opposing fingertips applying normal force to prevent slip. The contact involves surface-area contact along each finger pad maintaining this pinch grasp throughout the motion.\n- Motion Type: To break the wrist joint, a torque is applied that exceeds its mechanical hinge resistance. This involves simultaneously holding the wrist piece steady with one finger and applying a rotational torque at the joint along an axis aligned with the natural hinge rotation (likely the wrist’s flexion-extension axis). A combination of rotational motion about the joint axis and stabilizing linear forces ensures sufficient load to fracture the wrist.\n- Contact Considerations: Additional force along the perpendicular linear axes is necessary to maintain the firm grasp and prevent slippage due to torque application. A small downward force helps stabilize the wrist during rotation and counters gravity.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of rotational motion about the wrist’s X-axis (hinge axis), with stabilizing linear forces in negative Y and negative Z directions of the wrist frame.\n- Task duration: The task involves ramping torque until failure, estimated at approximately 3 seconds to safely apply forces and observe joint breakage without dynamic shock loading.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass = 0.5 kg, gravity force = 4.9 N, friction coefficient = 0.6, hinge resistance torque ~2.0 N-m estimated based on typical small wrist hinge.\n- Relevant equations: \n   Friction force, F_fric = μ * F_normal\n   Required torque, τ_break > hinge resistance ~2.0 N-m\n   Force torque relation: τ = F * r, with estimated radius r ~0.02 m at the joint interface\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist breaks at torque slightly above 2 N-m, friction is sufficient to prevent slip at a minimum grasping force around 20 N, radius of torque application is 2 cm.\n- Computations: To achieve torque > 2 N-m, force applied tangentially must be F = τ/r = 2.0 / 0.02 = 100 N. This is distributed partly between robotic wrist and fixture finger, so robot applies ~50 N tangential force combined with stabilizing normal force. Grasp normal force must exceed tangential force divided by friction coefficient to avoid slip: F_normal > 50/0.6 ≈ 83 N. Estimating grasping force in the range 85-100 N to guarantee no slip and enable application of 50 N torque load.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface: To overcome hinge resistance and friction, torque of about 2 N-m requires tangential force approximately 50 N at 0.02 m radius, stabilized by 85-100 N normal grasping force.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the requirement to stabilize the wrist against reaction forces during torque application, the robot must exert negative force along the X-axis with magnitude 20 N on the object in the image (pushing inward to keep the wrist piece firmly held).\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply counteracting force perpendicular to the torque direction to maintain grasp, the robot must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 85 N (normal grasp force).\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon stabilizing the wrist piece against gravity and reaction forces during breaking, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 15 N (downward stabilizing force).\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the physical requirement to break the hinge, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 2.5 N-m (exceeding the 2.0 N-m hinge resistance).\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the task requiring no motion about this axis, the robot must exert no torque about the Y-axis.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the task requiring no motion about this axis, the robot must exert no torque about the Z-axis.\nGrasping force: Estimated force range for grasping is 85 to 100 N to generate sufficient frictional grip preventing slip during torque application while stabilizing the wrist piece. This is justified by friction coefficient of 0.6 and required tangential force of ~50 N to achieve torque required to break the wrist.\n\n[end of motion plan]",
