  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The wrist joint likely consists of a metallic or composite joint assembly with moderate stiffness and an articulated hinge joint. The mass is small, approximately 1.5 kg, as wrists are generally light components. The static friction coefficient at the joint pivot is high due to metal-on-metal contact with lubrication, approximately 0.2. Breaking the wrist requires overcoming the hinge resistance which includes the joint torque limit and structural stiffness before failure.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward creating a load on the wrist. The wrist is currently grasped by the robot, so stability and grip friction matter. The hinge resistance is moderate; the environment (table or fixture) may provide resistance if the wrist is fixed or constrained. Surface friction between the gripper and wrist is high (at least 0.6) to prevent slip.\n- The relevant object is an articulated wrist joint assembly with metal components and rubber/foam grip surfaces. It has mass 1.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.\n- The surface of interaction is the robot's gripper fingers made of rubberized material with friction coefficient 0.6 with the wrist surface.\n- Contact Types: A firm pinch grasp contact on the wrist shaft is maintained with distributed surface contact to avoid slippage. Edge contact or point contact is avoided to spread force and avoid damage other than desired break.\n- Motion Type: The motion involves applying a torsional force exceeding the wrist joint's yield torque while maintaining grip. This involves rotational motion around the joint axis (likely the wrist's longitudinal axis) with potentially a small axial pull or push to assist breaking.\n- Contact Considerations: To prevent slippage during torque application, the robot must apply counteracting normal forces perpendicular to the rotation axis. Additional forces along the gripper's normal to the wrist surface are required to maintain grip during torque.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts rotational motion primarily along the wrist's Z-axis (joint axis) combined with stabilizing normal forces along the wrist X and Y axes to maintain grasp stability and counteract resistive forces.\n- Task duration: The breaking motion should be rapid to exceed joint yield, estimated at approximately 3 seconds including grasp stabilization, torque buildup, and break.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass = 1.5 kg, friction coefficient grip = 0.6, hinge yield torque ≈ 3.5 N-m, gripper finger surface area sufficient for 50 N normal force, gravity force = 1.5*9.81 = 14.7 N downward load.\n- Relevant equations: Torque τ = Force × lever arm distance; Frictional force F_friction = μ * Normal force; Required gripping force N ≥ breaking torque / (μ * radius of wrist axis).\n- Relevant assumptions: The lever arm radius of grasp ≈ 0.02 m; uniform friction at contacts; wrist joint yields plastically at about 3.5 N-m torque; negligible dynamic effects beyond static friction.\n- Computations: Required gripping normal force N ≥ 3.5 N-m / (0.6 * 0.02 m) = 3.5 / 0.012 = approx 292 N. However, this is very high and likely an overestimate assuming full friction located only at contact radius; in practice, the grip force is distributed and assisted by pushing forces along other axes to maintain contact. A conservative grip force of 40 to 60 N is sufficient with torque applied carefully.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 1.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface: To apply the 3.5 N-m torque, the robot applies a tangential force F_torque = τ / r = 3.5 N-m / 0.02 m = 175 N tangential force at the grasp surface, balanced by grip normal force at 40-60 N range, relying on precise friction control and wrist design.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task and based upon the requirement to maintain grip stability against lateral slipping and to stabilize the wrist during twisting, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude approximately 30 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task and based upon maintaining grip normal forces to prevent slippage and counter bending forces from the wrist joint, the robot must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude approximately 40 N.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task and based upon assisting in breaking the wrist joint via axial pulling, the robot must exert positive linear force along the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 25 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon stabilizing the wrist pivot during torque application, the robot must exert no torque about the X-axis.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon stabilizing the wrist pivot during torque application, the robot must exert no torque about the Y-axis.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the physical requirement of applying torsion to break the wrist joint about its hinge axis, the robot must exert clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 4 N-m.\nGrasping force:  Estimated gripping force must overcome the high friction threshold and the torque related normal forces, with estimated force range from 40 to 60 N based on friction coefficient 0.6 and force required to prevent slip while applying torque.\n[end of motion plan]",
