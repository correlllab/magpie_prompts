  "response": "[start of motion plan]  \nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:  \n- Object Properties: The wrist is an articulated joint typically composed of metal and plastic components with moderate stiffness; the mass of the wrist assembly gripped is approximately 1.0 kg. The wrist joint has a mechanical hinge designed to withstand normal operational torques up to about 2–3 N·m but can break under excessive force or torque. The static friction coefficient between the robot’s gripper rubber surface and the wrist material is estimated at 0.6.  \n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward with acceleration 9.81 m/s². The wrist joint hinge resists rotation with a torque of approximately 1.5 N·m before damage occurs. No significant external supports or surface contacts are impacting the wrist aside from the gripping robot fingers. Ambient surface friction between the wrist and robot fingertips is moderate, and no stable external supports are involved.  \n- The relevant object is the robot wrist joint assembly, composed of metal and plastic, mass 1.0 kg, with a static friction coefficient of 0.6 between the gripper fingertips and wrist surface.  \n- The surface of interaction is the robot fingertips’ rubber coating contacting the wrist, with a static friction coefficient of 0.6 to prevent slippage during grasping and torque application.  \n- Contact Types: The grasp is a firm, full circumferential pinch grasp around the wrist cylindrical section ensuring stable torque transmission with no slip. Contact is maintained on opposite sides of the wrist to maximize the breaking torque leverage. No edge contacts are used.  \n- Motion Type: The task requires rotational torque application around the wrist joint axis (assumed roughly aligned with wrist’s Z-axis) with simultaneous grasping force to maintain hold. The motion breaks the wrist by applying an over-torque rotational motion while maintaining firm grip. Minimal linear motion is needed beyond slight positioning adjustments.  \n- Contact Considerations: To maintain the grasp during high torque application, additional linear gripping force along the Y-axis (normal to gripping surfaces) is required to prevent slippage. Small compensatory forces along X and Z linear axes may help maintain stable contact during the applied torque.  \n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts rotational motion primarily along the wrist’s Z-axis (clockwise torque to break the wrist). Minor linear forces along Y-axis (positive, gripping force) and slight negative linear force along X-axis to stabilize are applied. No motions are required along the linear Z-axis or rotational X, Y axes.  \n- Task duration: The breaking motion is fast and forceful but controlled, lasting approximately 2 seconds to apply torque progressively until breakage occurs.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):  \n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist mass m = 1.0 kg, gravitational force F_g = 9.81 N, static friction coefficient μ_s = 0.6. Hinge break torque T_break ≈ 2.5 N·m.  \n- Relevant equations: Required grip force F_grip must satisfy F_grip * μ_s ≥ torque force reaction at grip interface to avoid slip. Torque τ = Force_perpendicular * Lever_arm_length.  \n- Relevant assumptions: Lever arm length for torque is approximately 0.03 m (distance from applied finger force to wrist joint axis). Linear acceleration effects neglected; quasi-static torque application assumed.  \n- Computations:  \n  To apply T_break = 2.5 N·m around the Z-axis with lever arm r = 0.03 m:  \n  Required tangential force F_tang = T_break / r = 2.5 / 0.03 ≈ 83.3 N.  \n  To avoid slip, F_grip * μ_s ≥ F_tang → F_grip ≥ 83.3 / 0.6 ≈ 139 N total gripping force distributed on both grippers → about 70 N per finger.  \n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 1.0 kg and static friction coefficient 0.6 along the surface: To prevent slip during torque, maintain at least 140 N total grip force with a clockwise torque of 2.5 N·m applied about the Z-axis.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:  \nLinear X-axis: To stabilize the wrist during breaking torque, the robot must exert a slight negative force along the X-axis of approximately 5 N to counteract lateral instability.  \nLinear Y-axis: To maintain a secure grip and prevent slip during high torque application, the robot must exert a positive force along the Y-axis of approximately 140 N distributed over the grippers.  \nLinear Z-axis: No linear force is required along the Z-axis as the motion is rotational breaking around Z; therefore, no force along Z-axis.  \nAngular X-axis: No angular torque required about the X-axis since breaking is about the hinge axis (Z-axis).  \nAngular Y-axis: No angular torque required about the Y-axis for this task.  \nAngular Z-axis: To break the wrist joint, the robot must exert a clockwise torque about the Z-axis of approximately 2.5 N·m to exceed hinge break resistance.  \nGrasping force: Based on friction and required reaction torque force, the grasping force must be in the range of 120 N to 160 N total (60–80 N per finger) to maintain grip and avoid slippage under torque.\n\n[end of motion plan]",
