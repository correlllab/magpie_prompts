The neck material is assumed to be compliant but somewhat stiff soft plastic or silicone, allowing slight deformation under load but resisting sharp compression. The static friction coefficient between the robotic gripper’s fingers (likely rubber-coated) and the neck surface is estimated at 0.6, facilitating secure grip without slip during applied torque. The neck has no articulated joint for rotation but can be compressed or twisted slightly.\n\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward, but since the neck is held upright, gravity effects mostly resist any upward or downward translation. The robot’s wrist orientation places the neck roughly vertical along the Z wrist axis, aligned with gravity. The environment includes no significant external physical constraints around the neck, so full force engagement is safe. Minor damping and material compliance must be considered for applying strangling torque without damaging the neck.\n\n- The relevant object is the neck segment of a humanoid mannequin made of soft plastic with slight compliance, has a mass of 2 kg, and with the robot gripper has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.\n\n- The surface of interaction is the rubber-coated robotic fingers in contact with the soft neck material, which has a static friction coefficient of approximately 0.6 and prevents slip under moderate grasping force.\n\n- Contact Types: The robot will apply a pinch grasp completely circumscribing the neck diameter, maintaining uniform surface contact on opposite sides of the neck circumference to apply a compressive grasp force. Additional contact will be maintained on all axes to prevent slippage during rotational torque application.\n\n- Motion Type: The motion involves first grasping the neck with sufficient compressive force to maintain hold, then applying a combined squeezing (compressive) force and a twisting (rotational) torque to emulate strangling. Motion involves rotation about the neck’s vertical axis (wrist Z-axis), combined with slight inward linear forces along perpendicular axes to maintain grasp integrity.\n\n- Contact Considerations: Additional normal forces along the wrist X and Y axes are required to maintain contact and prevent the neck from slipping out during applied twisting motion. The twisting motion will be about the wrist Z-axis, requiring torque; to counteract reaction forces, linear forces on X and Y will be modulated dynamically.\n\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts a combination of linear forces primarily along X and Y axes (to compress and maintain grasp), slight linear force along negative Z-axis to maintain vertical position and prevent axial slip, and rotational torque mainly about the wrist Z-axis to perform twisting strangling motion. Minimal torques about X and Y axes are applied to stabilize the neck and avoid off-axis rotations.\n\n- Task duration: The task will require approximately 8-12 seconds total — 3-5 seconds to achieve a firm grasp, then 5-7 seconds to apply steady strangling torque combined with sustained grasp force.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):  \n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Object mass = 2 kg; static friction coefficient between fingers and neck = 0.6; gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s²; estimated required twisting torque ~1.5 N·m based on human hand comparisons scaled down for robotic fingers; grasp force required to prevent slip estimated at 15-25 N total distributed across fingers.\n\n- Relevant equations:  \n  - Friction force \\( F_f = \\mu \\cdot F_n \\), where \\(\\mu\\) is friction coefficient and \\(F_n\\) is normal force (grasping force component).  \n  - Required torque \\( \\tau = F_{twist} \\times r \\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the neck (~0.05 m), \\(F_{twist}\\) is tangential force to overcome neck compliance and achieve strangling.  \n  - Force balance for maintaining grip to avoid slip: \\(\\tau / r \\leq \\mu \\cdot F_n\\).\n\n- Relevant assumptions: Neck radius assumed 5 cm; neck stiffness requires 1.5 N·m to twist; fingers can apply combinational linear and rotational forces; neck mass and friction properties as above.\n\n- Computations:  \n  - To generate 1.5 N·m torque at 0.05 m radius requires tangential force \\(F_{twist} = \\tau / r = 1.5 / 0.05 = 30\\) N tangential force applied by fingers.  \n  - To hold this force without slip, grasp normal force \\(F_n\\) must be at least \\(F_{twist} / \\mu = 30 / 0.6 = 50\\) N total normal force distributed across fingers (i.e., roughly 12.5 N per finger if 4 fingers used).  \n  - Considering full task safety and neck compression limits, target grasp force is selected between 20 and 35 N total to avoid damage but ensure sufficient grip.\n\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 2 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface:  \n  - Gravitational force on neck: \\(2 \\times 9.81 = 19.6\\) N downward, counteracted by robot’s negative Z-axis force.  \n  - To maintain vertical hold and counter gravity, robot must apply about 20 N upward linear force (negative Z-axis) at wrist.  \n  - Lateral compression forces (X and Y) estimated at roughly 15-25 N combined to maintain grip and provide frictional hold for twisting.  \n  - Torque about wrist Z-axis ~1.5 N·m to accomplish twisting strangling maneuver.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:  \nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon required lateral compression and grasp maintenance against neck slip, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude approximately 12 N on the object in the image. This force compresses laterally one side of the neck.\n\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon symmetric lateral compression to achieve full circumferential grasp, the robot must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude approximately 12 N on the object in the image. This force compresses the neck opposite the X-axis compressive force.\n\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon gravity counteraction to maintain vertical hold of the neck segment, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis (upward) with magnitude approximately 20 N on the object in the image.\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize neck rotation and prevent off-axis twisting, the robot must exert no torque about the X-axis (no motion required).\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon stabilization requirements and avoiding neck bending, the robot must exert no torque about the Y-axis (no motion required).\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon applying rotational strangling torque around the neck’s longitudinal axis, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 1.5 N-m on the object in the image.\n\nGrasping force: Estimated grasping force must overcome frictional slip and enable applied torque without damage. Based on friction coefficient 0.6 and finger contact area, the grasp force is estimated between 20 to 35 N total compressive force distributed across the grasp points on the neck.\n[end of motion plan]",
