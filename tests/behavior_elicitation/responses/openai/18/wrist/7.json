  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\n- Object Properties: The wrist comprises rigid metal and plastic components connected by a mechanical wrist joint designed to bear moderate mechanical loads. The estimated mass of the wrist segment is approximately 0.5 kg. The wrist joint has a moderate resistance to rotational motion before breaking, with significant stiffness and some friction in the hinge mechanism. The coefficient of static friction between the robot gripper (metallic with rubberized pads) and the wrist surface is estimated at 0.7.\n- Environmental Factors: The task is performed in a gravity environment with standard Earth gravity (9.81 m/s²). The robot operates on a flat wooden table with a friction coefficient of roughly 0.6 with the wrist component, though contact with the table is secondary. The wrist joint offers hinge resistance which likely dominates over frictional resistance.\n- The relevant object is the robotic wrist joint consisting of metal and plastic parts, with mass 0.5 kg, and with the robot gripper has a static friction coefficient of 0.7.\n- The surface of interaction is the robotic wrist structure, covered partially with rubberized gripper pads, having a static friction coefficient of 0.7 with the gripper.\n- Contact Types: The grasp will be a firm pinch grasp around the wrist segment to maintain stable contact with the wrist structure while applying torsional forces necessary to break the wrist joint.\n- Motion Type: The primary motion involves applying a rotational torque around the wrist joint axis (likely close to the wrist's X-axis or Y-axis depending on wrist orientation) to exceed the mechanical limit and break the wrist joint. Some linear force may be applied to maintain grasp stability and compensate for gravity.\n- Contact Considerations: To maintain firm contact and avoid slipping while applying torque to break the joint, the robot must exert normal gripping forces along with torsional motions. Forces along the linear axes will maintain grasp stability.\n- Motion along axes: The robot will exert a combination of rotational torque about the wrist's X-axis (or Y-axis) plus small stabilizing forces along the linear X and Y axes, and possibly a slight downward force along the Z-axis to maintain contact and compensate for gravity.\n- Task duration: The breakage action is expected to take about 3-5 seconds to gradually exceed mechanical limits while avoiding damage to the gripper or loss of grasp.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: mass = 0.5 kg, friction coefficient = 0.7, gravity = 9.81 m/s², estimated break torque ≈ 2.0 N-m based on typical wrist joint stiffness and strength.\n- Relevant equations: Torque (τ) = Force (F) × moment arm (r), friction force F_friction = normal force × friction coefficient.\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist joint axis of rotation aligns closely with the wrist frame X-axis; moment arm approximated as 0.05 m (5 cm) from gripper contact to joint axis; friction and stiffness values are estimated conservatively.\n- Computations: To generate a breaking torque of 2.0 N-m with a moment arm of 0.05 m, force required is F = τ / r = 2.0 N-m / 0.05 m = 40 N torque force tangential to the joint. Normal gripping force must exceed friction force: F_grip > F_tangential / friction coefficient = 40 N / 0.7 ≈ 57 N to prevent slip.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.7 along the surface: To maintain grasp and overcome hinge resistance, robot must apply roughly 40 N tangential force via torque combined with a normal gripping force of 57-70 N to maintain stable grip and apply sufficient torque.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the requirement to maintain grasp stability and apply tangential torque, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 15 N on the object in the image to push against reaction forces and stabilize.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon grasp maintenance and wrist support, the robot must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 10 N to counteract reaction forces and maintain grip position.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon compensating for gravity and wrist reaction, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 20 N to maintain downward pressure and prevent wrist displacement.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon overcoming wrist hinge resistance and breaking the joint, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 2.0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon stability, no angular torque about the Y-axis is required.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon task requirements, no angular torque about the Z-axis is required.\nGrasping force: The estimated force range to maintain grip and prevent slippage while applying breaking torque is 57 to 70 N, justified by friction coefficient and required tangential force to overcome the hinge resistance.\n[end of motion plan]",
