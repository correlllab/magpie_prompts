  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\n- Object Properties: The wrist is a mechanical joint likely consisting of metal components connected by a hinge or rotational joint, with moderate stiffness and some resistance to breakage. The mass of the wrist assembly is estimated to be around 0.5 kg based on the relative size and metallic structure. The friction coefficient at the gripper contact is reasonably high due to the gripper pad material and the metallic part, estimated at 0.6 static friction coefficient.\n- Environmental Factors: The wrist is held stationary against a flat, stable wooden table surface with low friction (approx. 0.3 static friction coefficient). Gravity acts downward. The wrist hinge resists rotational motion but could be broken or disassembled with sufficient torque. The table prevents downward movement.\n- The relevant object is the robot wrist assembly consisting of metal and plastic components, having an estimated mass of 0.5 kg, and the robot gripper has a static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the wrist surface.\n- The surface of interaction is a flat wooden table with static friction coefficient about 0.3 against the wrist assembly.\n- Contact Types: A firm pinch grasp must be maintained on the wrist using the gripper fingers to ensure stability. Edge contact is maintained on the wrist. The contact must resist slip during forceful torque application.\n- Motion Type: To break the wrist, the robot must apply a combination of grasping force and rotational torque around the wrist joint axis, while counteracting forces to maintain contact and resist the hinge's structural integrity.\n- Contact Considerations: Additional force along the linear axes is required to maintain the wrist steady against the table and prevent slipping. The grasping force must prevent the wrist slipping within the gripper during the torque application.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts forces along linear X (positive outwards along the gripper opening direction), and linear Z (negative, pressing down towards table) for stability, and rotational torque mainly about the angular Y-axis (clockwise rotation) to break the wrist hinge. Minimal forces along Y-axis and torques about X and Z axes are necessary.\n- Task duration: The task is expected to be forceful but quick, approximately 3 to 5 seconds of sustained force and torque application to overcome structural resistance.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass = 0.5 kg; friction coefficient between gripper and wrist = 0.6; hinge resistance torque estimated at 5 N-m.\n- Relevant equations: Torque = Force x Lever arm; Friction force = Normal force x friction coefficient.\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist hinge requires approximately 5 N-m torque to break; gripper pads provide sufficient grip to exert required torque without slipping; table firmly holds wrist in place, generating reactive forces.\n- Computations: To apply 5 N-m torque with an assumed lever arm of 0.05 m (5 cm, typical wrist dimension), grasping force must be at least 5 N-m / 0.05 m = 100 N tangential gripping force, factoring friction reduces required torque force to about 60 N gripping force. To prevent slipping, linear gripping force normal to the wrist surface must exceed this.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface: To break the wrist, the robot must exert at least 60 N tangential gripping force combined with about 5 N downward force pressing on the table to stabilize.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain a strong lateral grasp and resist slipping, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 60 N on the wrist.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon maintaining contact without unnecessary lateral motion side-to-side, the robot must exert no force along the Y-axis.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist against the table and resist rotation, the robot must exert negative linear force along the Z-axis (pressing downward) with magnitude 5 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon task requirements, no torque about the X-axis is necessary.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to break the wrist joint by rotating it, the robot must exert clockwise angular torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 5 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon maintaining the wrist orientation without twisting around the gripper axis, no torque about the Z-axis is necessary.\nGrasping force: Estimated grasping force range is 60 to 80 N to ensure sufficient friction and torque transfer without slippage.\n\n[end of motion plan]",

The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format.
