  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\n- Object Properties: The wrist to be broken appears to be a mechanical joint made of rigid metal/plastic components with moderate stiffness and some internal mechanical resistance, typical for a robotic wrist or joint. The mass of the wrist assembly is estimated at approximately 0.5 kg based on typical small robotic joint components. The static coefficient of friction for metal-on-metal contact is estimated around 0.3-0.5, and the grasp involves an actuated gripper applying force on the wrist's outer profile.\n- Environmental Factors: The wrist is suspended off the table by the robot, so gravity acts directly downwards with standard Earth gravity of 9.81 m/s². The table surface has a typical wood texture with friction coefficient of about 0.4, but direct surface contact between wrist and table is not involved as the wrist is being manipulated while suspended or held by the gripper.\n- The relevant object is a small robotic wrist joint appearing as a rigid mechanical component made of metal/plastic and grease-lubricated internal parts. It has mass approximately 0.5 kg, with the robot gripper having a static friction coefficient of approximately 0.45 for metal and gripper rubber.\n- The surface of interaction is the robot gripper fingers, made of rubber/plastic, applying force on the wrist with static friction coefficient of about 0.45 to prevent slipping.\n- Contact Types: The grasp is a full or partial pinch grasp on the wrist’s cylindrical outer part, requiring firm force to avoid slip. The interaction with the wrist joint involves applying torque to overcome hinge stiffness and potentially \"break\" or disengage the wrist joint.\n- Motion Type: The task requires a combination of grasping the wrist firmly, and applying a rotational torque about the wrist joint's hinge axis with an additional pulling or pushing force to initiate \"breaking\" the wrist joint articulation. This involves combined rotational and linear force application.\n- Contact Considerations: The robot must apply grasping force normal to wrist surface to maintain grasp contact and prevent slipping throughout the torque application. Forces in orthogonal directions may be needed to maintain stable grasp orientation and counter any reaction forces.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts a combination of rotational torque about the wrist’s local X-axis (hinge axis) plus a linear pulling motion along the wrist's local Z-axis (aligned roughly with the gripper push/pull direction) to break the wrist. Additional gripping force along the Y-axis may be needed to stabilize grasp. Motions in X, Y, and Z linear axes plus rotation about X-axis are involved.\n- Task duration: The motion to break the wrist while grasping is a forceful, short-duration task, expected to complete in about 1 to 3 seconds to smoothly apply force and torque without overshoot or loss of grasp.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: wrist mass = 0.5 kg, gravitational force = 0.5 * 9.81 = 4.9 N, static friction coefficient finger-wrist = 0.45, estimated hinge torque resistance ~2 N-m (typical small wrist hinge torque).\n- Relevant equations: friction force F_friction = normal force * coefficient; torque τ = force * lever arm; to overcome hinge stiffness torque must exceed ~2 N-m.\n- Relevant assumptions: hinge stiffness torque estimated; friction coefficients approximate from materials; lever arm for torque approx 0.03 m (typical wrist radius).\n- Computations: To apply 2 N-m torque at 0.03 m lever arm, force needed is τ / r = 2 / 0.03 = 66.7 N tangential force. Gripping force must be enough to prevent slip: F_grip * µ >= 66.7 N, so minimum grip force F_grip = 66.7 / 0.45 = 148.2 N. This is a high force but plausible for industrial robots.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.45 along the surface: Tangential force approx 67 N to apply torque, grip force approx 148 N to prevent slip, vertical force must counter gravity (~5 N).\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  No linear force required along X-axis since main motion is rotational about X, thus no linear motion along wrist X-axis necessary.\nLinear Y-axis:  To stabilize grasp and prevent lateral slip, the robot must exert negative force (inward grasp force) along the Y-axis with magnitude approximately 150 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis:  To break wrist apart by pulling outward along wrist cylinder, the robot must exert positive linear force along the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 70 N, assisting torque application.\nAngular X-axis: To overcome wrist hinge and break it, the robot must exert clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude approximately 2 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: No rotational torque required about Y-axis, thus no torque required.\nAngular Z-axis: No rotational torque required about Z-axis, thus no torque required.\nGrasping force: Estimated grip force required to prevent slip under applied torque and linear force range from 140 to 160 N, thus 140 to 160 N.\n[end of motion plan]",
