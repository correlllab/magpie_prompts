The mass of the wrist joint is roughly estimated to be around 1.5 kg based on its size and material. The static friction coefficient at the grasp interface (robot gripper fingertips on the wrist) is assumed to be about 0.6, given the rubberized gripper pads and metal/plastic surfaces. The wrist joint likely has a mechanical hinge or rotational degree of freedom that resists applied torques up to a certain threshold before it breaks or detaches. The stiffness and hinge resistance force can be estimated moderately high due to typical metal joint construction.  \n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward (-Z in the workspace image), with the table providing a stable horizontal surface and moderate friction (~0.5 for the wrist joint against the table). Air resistance is negligible. The wrist joint to be broken is supported partially by the robot’s gripper and possibly resting lightly on the table surface. Hinge resistance must be overcome to break the joint.  \n- The relevant object is a robot wrist joint consisting of metal and plastic parts connected by mechanical hinges. It has mass approximately 1.5 kg, with the robot gripper applying a static friction coefficient of 0.6.  \n- The surface of interaction is a wooden or laminate table with friction coefficient approximately 0.5.  \n- Contact Types: The robot must maintain a pinch grasp on the wrist joint, primarily contact with the gripper fingertips around the wrist outer surface to both hold and apply torque. Surface contact with the table under the wrist joint must be maintained or accounted for to stabilize the object during breaking.  \n- Motion Type: The task involves applying a rotational force (torque) around the hinge axis while maintaining a strong grasp and possibly applying a small counter force linearly along the wrist axes to position and stabilize. This is a combination of rotational breaking motion coupled with linear grip forces.  \n- Contact Considerations: Additional axial forces along the gripper’s linear axes are required to maintain firm contact and prevent slippage while applying torque. The grasp force must counteract reactive forces due to torque and friction.  \n- Motion along axes: The robot primarily exerts a rotational torque along the wrist’s Z-axis (aligned with the joint hinge axis) to break the wrist, combined with linear force along the gripper closing axis (X-axis) to maintain grasp and possibly a small Z-axis force for stabilization. Minor forces along Y-axis will prevent lateral slipping, ensuring contact stability.  \n- Task duration: This is a quick forceful task estimated to last about 1.5 seconds, sufficient to overcome hinge resistance and break the wrist joint.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):  \n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass = 1.5 kg, static friction coefficient gripper-to-wrist = 0.6, friction coefficient wrist-to-table = 0.5, hinge torque resistance estimated ~3 N-m.  \n- Relevant equations: Torque τ = Force × lever arm distance; friction force F_f = μ × normal force; torque required must exceed hinge torque resistance to break joint.  \n- Relevant assumptions: Lever arm for torque application ~0.05 m (grasp around wrist), gripper pads provide friction sufficient to prevent slip up to grasp force estimates, hinge breaks once torque > 3 N-m applied.  \n- Computations: Required torque to break wrist τ_break ≈ 3 N-m. To apply this torque with lever arm 0.05 m, Force F = τ_break / lever arm = 3 N-m / 0.05 m = 60 N tangential force needed. Gripper must apply at least this much tangential force via torque and maintain grip with normal force to prevent slip. Normal grip force F_grip must satisfy F_grip × μ ≥ 60 N → F_grip ≥ 60 N / 0.6 ≈ 100 N gripping force to prevent slippage during torque.  \n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 1.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface: The torque to break is dominant, requiring tangential forces and countering reactive forces that require strong grip force (~100 N). Linear forces to hold the object against gravity (~15 N) are smaller.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:  \nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain a firm grasp against tangential torque while slightly pulling to align the wrist joint, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 100 N on the object in the image.  \nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to prevent lateral slip and stabilize the wrist during torque application, the robot must exert small positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 10 N on the object in the image.  \nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to counteract gravity and stabilize the wrist while applying torque, the robot must exert small positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude 15 N on the object in the image.  \nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the object’s hinge orientation and the workspace setup, no angular torque is required about the X-axis (no motion required).  \nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the hinge being aligned mostly along the Z-axis, no angular torque is required about the Y-axis (no motion required).  \nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon overcoming the hinge resistance by twisting the wrist joint, the robot must exert clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 3 N-m on the object in the image.  \nGrasping force: The estimated force range is between 100 and 120 N to ensure sufficient grip to prevent slip when applying breaking torque, considering friction coefficient 0.6 and required tangential force to break hinge, thus 100 to 120 N.\n\n[end of motion plan]",
