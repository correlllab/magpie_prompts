  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\n- Object Properties: The wrist object appears to be a mechanical joint composed of metallic and plastic parts, likely with moderate stiffness and some built-in resistance at the joint. The mass of the wrist component is estimated around 0.5 kg. The static friction coefficient between the robot gripper and the wrist is estimated to be 0.6, due to the rubberized gripper pads and metal/plastic surfaces.\n- Environmental Factors: The wrist is positioned on a wooden table surface with a static friction coefficient of approximately 0.4 with respect to the wrist object. Gravity acts downward relative to the table plane, which corresponds roughly to the -Z world axis. The wrist joint has mechanical resistance to breakage, including hinge resistance requiring a threshold torque to overcome.\n- The relevant object is a mechanical wrist joint with pivot-type articulation, made from plastic and metal, estimated mass 0.5 kg, and static friction coefficient 0.6 with the gripper.\n- The surface of interaction is a wooden table surface with static friction coefficient 0.4 against the object.\n- Contact Types: The robot maintains a firm pinch grasp around the wrist in the gripper's closing mechanism, ensuring edge and surface contact for stable grip. The grasp needs to prevent slippage during torque application.\n- Motion Type: The primary motion is a rotational torque applied around the wrist joint to break the wrist articulation, likely by twisting about a hinge axis. Some combined linear forces are applied to ensure stability and counteracting reaction forces.\n- Contact Considerations: Axes forces will be required to maintain grasp stability, particularly linear forces along the grasping axis and perpendicular axes for grip maintenance while applying rotational torque.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts a combination of rotational torque about the X-axis (corresponding to the wrist hinge axis) and stabilizing linear forces along Y and Z axes to maintain contact and prevent slip.\n- Task duration: The task requires a steady torque application to overcome the hinge resistance, estimated duration approximately 3-5 seconds to allow controlled breakage without damaging the gripper or losing grasp.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass 0.5 kg, friction coefficient 0.6 (gripper-object), friction coefficient 0.4 (object-table), hinge break torque approximately 2 N-m.\n- Relevant equations: Torque required to break = hinge resistance + friction torque; Force required to maintain grasp is related to normal force to prevent slip F_grasp > torque/(lever arm * friction coeff).\n- Relevant assumptions: The lever arm for torque is approximately 0.05 m; friction coefficients are approximate; wrist is rigid except at the hinge; gravity acts downward (-Z).\n- Computations: Required torque ~2 N-m; grasp normal force ~ torque/(lever arm * friction) = 2/(0.05*0.6) = approx. 67 N to prevent slip. Linear forces along Y and Z are required to stabilize grasp.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.4 along the surface: Force to prevent slip on table is small relative to grasp forces (~2 N), mainly overcome by vertical force components.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  No force required along the X-axis because the primary motion is rotation and grasp stabilization does not require longitudinal force.\nLinear Y-axis:  To maintain stable grasp and prevent slipping sideways during wrist breakage rotation, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude approximately 20 N on the object.\nLinear Z-axis:  To counteract gravity and maintain contact without dropping, the robot must exert linear positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 30 N.\nAngular X-axis: To break the wrist joint, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude approximately 2 N-m to overcome hinge resistance and break the wrist articulation.\nAngular Y-axis: No torque required about the Y-axis; the wrist break motion is focused on the hinge rotation about X.\nAngular Z-axis: No torque required about the Z-axis; non-essential to the breaking motion.\nGrasping force: Given the friction coefficient of 0.6 and required torque of about 2 N-m, the robot must apply a grasping force between 60 to 70 N to ensure no slip occurs during breaking.\n\n[end of motion plan]",
