The environment contains various equipment and objects, indicating an indoor lab or workshop setting. The robot end-effector (wrist) is oriented such that the grasp point is at the gripper. The task to \"break the wrist while grasping the wrist\" implies applying sufficient force and torque at the wrist joint of the robot or an articulated object held by the gripper to cause mechanical failure or disarticulation at the wrist.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The wrist frame is shown with three axes — X (red), Y (green), and Z (blue). According to the world reference:\n- Upward motion in the world corresponds to upward direction in the camera image.\n- Rightward motion in the world corresponds to right direction in the camera image.\n- Forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera image.\n\nThe red X-axis points roughly horizontally to the right, aligned with rightward world motion.\nThe green Y-axis points roughly horizontal to the left, roughly opposite the forward motion in the world but skewed leftward.\nThe blue Z-axis points upwards, aligning with upward motion in the world frame.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to vertical upward (+Z) or downward (-Z) motion in the world. Positive Z wrist motion corresponds to motion lifting upwards away from the table, while negative Z is down towards the surface.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move positively (lift upwards) to generate tension and enable breaking of the wrist joint.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion rightward in the world. Positive wrist X motion corresponds to moving rightward or applying lateral force in the horizontal plane to the right.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move to provide lateral leverage or bending stress if required, so the object may move slightly positive or negative X to apply bending.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion somewhat forward/backward relative to the camera view but skewed leftward and horizontally.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, minimal motion is needed, but small horizontal shifts along Y could stabilize contact or apply torque.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved primarily upward along +Z (to apply separating tension at the wrist joint), possibly combined with slight lateral bending or rotational torque along X or Y axes to create mechanical stress that facilitates breaking.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish breaking the wrist:\n\n- Object Properties: The wrist joint is expected to be a mechanical joint composed of metal or durable plastic components. Estimated mass of the gripper and wrist assembly is about 1.0 to 2.0 kg. The wrist likely has some stiffness and mechanical resistance to breaking, with moderate friction at the joint bearings. Friction coefficient at contact points with gripper fingers is moderate, approximately 0.4 due to rubber pads.\n\n- Environmental Factors: The object is supported by the gripper and suspended in air during the motion task. Gravity acts downward with ~9.8 m/s² acceleration, so the robot must apply upward force to counteract the object's weight and additional force to stress the wrist. There is no external supporting surface at the wrist joint that would resist rotation, but the table below could be a reference surface if the object rests.\n\n- The relevant object is the wrist joint assembly and gripper interface, having approximate mass 1.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.4 at grasp contacts.\n\n- The surface of interaction is mainly the gripper’s rubber finger surface interacting with the object, having a static friction coefficient of approximately 0.4.\n\n- Contact Types: The gripper maintains a pinch grasp contact around the wrist assembly, ensuring a firm grip without slipping. Edge contact with finger pads provides friction points required for torque application.\n\n- Motion Type: The task involves a combination of upward linear motion (lifting and pulling) and rotational torque application (twisting or bending) to mechanically break or dislocate the wrist joint.\n\n- Contact Considerations: To maintain grasp during force application, force components along X and Y axes are necessary to balance contact forces and prevent slipping. The robot requires torque about the X and/or Y axes as well as linear force along Z for pulling apart.\n\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts a combination of linear motion along Z (upward lifting), and rotational torque about the X and Y axes (twisting or bending) to apply shear stress and ultimately break the wrist joint.\n\n- Task duration: Considering mechanical resistance and safety, the task will last approximately 3 to 5 seconds to gradually increase force and torque until breakage occurs.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Object mass = 1.5 kg, static friction coefficient = 0.4, gravitational acceleration = 9.8 m/s².\n\n- Relevant equations:\n  Force required to lift object = mass × gravity = 1.5 × 9.8 = 14.7 N.\n  Additional force to overcome friction and joint resistance estimated at ~20 N.\n  Torque to break joint estimated about 5 N-m based on typical wrist joint strength.\n\n- Relevant assumptions: Uniform friction distribution, rigid body assumptions for wrist assembly, no external external mechanical support at joint besides the robot grasp.\n\n- Computations: Total linear force along +Z to counteract object weight and apply force for breakage ~ 20 N.\n  Torque of about 5 N-m applied via rotation about X and/or Y axis sufficient to generate shear stress.\n\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 1.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.4 along the surface: \n  Force to overcome frictional grip at 0.4 friction coefficient:\n  F_friction = μ × Normal force; assuming normal force from gripping ~50 N,\n  F_friction = 0.4 × 50 = 20 N,\n  thus robot should apply >20 N linear force to avoid slip,\n  plus torque ~5 N-m to cause breakage.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task and based upon lateral bending requirements and frictional considerations, the object in the image must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 10 N to apply lateral bending stress and maintain grasp stability.\n\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task and based upon minimal lateral shift to stabilize grasp, the object in the image must exert no force along the Y-axis (0 N).\n\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task and based upon overcoming gravity and applying breaking tension, the object in the image must exert linear positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude 25 N.\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon required bending torque to break wrist joints, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 5 N-m.\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon torque-assisted twisting requirements, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 3 N-m.\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon minimal twisting about the gripping axis, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Z-axis (0 N-m).\n\nGrasping force: Estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, and required resistance suggests a grasping force of 40 to 60 N to prevent slip while applying the task forces and torques, thus 40 to 60 N.\n[end of motion plan]",
