  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms that the robot manipulator is positioned above a wooden table in an indoor lab environment. The robot gripper is aligned roughly parallel to the table surface and is oriented such that the grasping point (wrist joint to be broken) is accessible. The wrist joint appears to be a mechanical hinge joint on the robot arm, likely made of metal or alloy with rigid components and some resistance in the hinge. The environment shows the robot situated over a flat surface with objects and cables in the background, but these do not interfere with the task.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such:\n- The wrist frame is located at the point of grasping on the wrist joint.\n- +Z (blue axis) points upwards roughly aligned with the vertical direction in the world.\n- +X (red axis) roughly points to the right in the world frame, nearly parallel to the tabletop surface and the edge of the workbench.\n- +Y (green axis) points forward/out of the workspace camera view, forward with respect to the robot’s base.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to vertical motion along the upward world direction, i.e., positive Z axis motion lifts the wrist upwards away from the table, and negative Z lowers it downwards toward the table surface.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move negatively (downward) initially to engage any mechanical resistance in the hinge and then positively (upward) to apply a force sufficient to break or dislocate the wrist hinge.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to lateral motion to the robot's right side in the world, parallel to the surface of the table.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move with a small amount of lateral displacement to induce torque about the wrist joint, helping to pry or shear the wrist hinge.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward motion out of the camera view, pointing away from the robot base.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move slightly backward (negative Y direction) or maintain position to stabilize the wrist and prevent unwanted translations during the break operation.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved primarily with a combination of downward (negative Z), slight lateral (positive X), and minimal to no forward/backward (Y) translation, combined with high torque about relevant rotational axes to break the wrist hinge.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish breaking the wrist while grasping it, we consider:\n\n- Object Properties: The wrist joint is a metal mechanical hinge with some stiffness and resistance due to metal-metal contact and possibly lubricants. The mass of the wrist segment is small, approximately 1 to 2 kg. Friction at the hinge is moderate with a coefficient roughly 0.4 to 0.5.\n\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward with 9.81 m/s² acceleration. The table surface provides no direct support or resistance to the wrist breaking but could resist downward forces if the wrist contacts the table.\n\n- The relevant object is the wrist joint assembly made of metal components and housing, with estimated mass 1.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6 (assuming rubber gripper pads).\n\n- The surface of interaction is the robot gripper's rubber pads, which have a static friction coefficient of approximately 0.6 with the metal wrist surface.\n\n- Contact Types: The robot maintains a firm pinch grasp on the wrist joint housing. This pinch grasp is crucial to keep the wrist stable while applying rotational and linear forces to break the hinge.\n\n- Motion Type: Forceful rotational motion to apply torque about the wrist joint hinge axis, combined with linear downward and lateral displacement to overcome mechanical resistance and break the wrist.\n\n- Contact Considerations: The robot must maintain high normal force to prevent slippage of the grasp on the wrist while applying torque. Forces in the X and Z linear directions are essential to maintain contact and induce motion.\n\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts a combination of linear motion along the X (lateral, prying), Z (vertical, pushing down/up) axes, and rotational torque about the X and Y axes to twist and break the wrist joint.\n\n- Task duration: Based on the mechanical resistance and stiffness, the task is expected to last approximately 3 to 5 seconds, allowing gradual application and buildup of forces to break the wrist without excessive speed.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: mass = 1.5 kg, friction coefficient grip-object = 0.6, estimated hinge break torque ~ 5 Nm.\n\n- Relevant equations: \n  Force to overcome friction: F_friction = normal_force * coefficient_of_friction\n  Torque to break hinge: τ_break >= 5 Nm (approximate)\n\n- Relevant assumptions:\n  The wrist joint hinge requires about 5 Nm torque to break.\n  Gravity effects must be compensated.\n  The grasp must apply normal force > gravitational force to prevent slippage.\n\n- Computations:\n  Gravitational force = m * g = 1.5 * 9.81 = 14.7 N downward.\n  To prevent slip, grasp normal force N_grasp must satisfy: N_grasp * 0.6 >= 14.7 N → N_grasp ≥ 24.5 N\n  Torque about X or Y axis must reach ≥ 5 Nm to break.\n\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 1.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6:\n  To break the wrist, robot applies:\n  - Grasp normal force ~ 25 to 30 N for stability.\n  - Linear downward push (negative Z) force ~20 N to engage hinge.\n  - Lateral (positive X) force ~10 N to pry.\n  - Rotational torque about X-axis ~5 Nm clockwise or counterclockwise as per hinge direction.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the lateral displacement needed to pry the wrist joint and overcome resistance, the object in the image must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 10 N.\n\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the position without forward motion, the object in the image must exert no force along the Y-axis (0 N).\n\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the application of downward pressure to engage the hinge and upward force to break, the object in the image must exert linear negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 20 N initially, then positive force of 15 N to complete break motion.\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the torque required to break the hinge joint, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 5 N-m.\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the primary rotational axis being the hinge (assumed aligned mostly with X-axis), the object in the image must exert no torque about the Y-axis (0 N-m).\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the absence of required torque around the wrist’s longitudinal axis, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Z-axis (0 N-m).\n\nGrasping force: The grasp must produce sufficient normal force to avoid slipping under load; estimated force range is 25 to 30 N, justified by friction between rubber gripper and metal wrist joint, and the weight and forces involved during breaking.\n\n[end of motion plan]",
