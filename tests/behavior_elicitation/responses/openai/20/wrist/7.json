  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the scene shows a robot arm with a gripper holding a mechanical wrist joint (likely part of a mannequin or similar articulation) lying on a wooden table. The wrist joint appears to consist of plastic and metal parts, likely with a hinge allowing rotational motion at the joint. The table surface is flat and wooden. The environment is indoors with standard gravity acting downward. The robot must grasp the mechanical wrist and apply motion sufficient to \"break\" the wrist, understood here as forcing the wrist joint beyond its normal range or breaking the hinge.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The wrist coordinate system is positioned at the gripper's point of grasping the wrist joint. The red (+X) axis points roughly forward and slightly right relative to the robot arm, the green (+Y) axis points roughly left from the perspective of the gripper, and the blue (+Z) axis points upwards in the camera's frame — roughly upward relative to the world.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward and downward motion in the world, meaning positive Z is upward lifting motion away from the table, and negative Z is downward motion towards the table.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move positively, i.e., the robot should lift the wrist joint upwards to attempt breaking or stressing the wrist joint against gravity.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to the forward and backward direction, roughly pointing from the robot base to the workspace center. Positive X is forward from the robot base perspective, negative X is backward.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move negatively or positively depending on the direction of rotational torque needed at the wrist joint to break or twist it. For this task, applying a twisting torque along the hinge axis is likely, so a small +/-X motion to assist rotation is possible, but primary motion is rotational rather than translational along X.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to left-right lateral motion from the gripper's perspective; positive Y is to the left in the image, negative Y to the right.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move with a small amplitude motion to help twist or apply bending torque about the wrist hinge if required. However, major translational motion along Y is less relevant, so limited Y movement is needed.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved primarily upward along the Z-axis combined with rotational torque around one or more axes (most likely around the X or Y axis) to create a break force on the wrist joint.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to break the wrist joint while grasping it, we must consider the following:\n\n- Object Properties: The wrist joint is likely comprised of rigid plastic and metal parts with a small hinge joint having moderate stiffness and some friction. Estimated mass of the wrist joint is approximately 0.2 kg. The friction coefficient between the gripper fingertips and the wrist surface is likely moderate, around 0.5, given typical rubber/soft plastic gripper pads.\n\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downwards. The wrist joint rests on a wooden table with moderate friction (~0.4 coefficient) between the wrist base and table surface, which the robot must overcome if moving the wrist laterally against the table or lifting it. The hinge resistance provides elastic restoring torque, which must be overcome to \"break\" the wrist.\n\n- The relevant object is a mechanical wrist joint composed of plastic and metal, has mass ~0.2 kg and with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of approximately 0.5.\n\n- The surface of interaction is a wooden table with a static friction coefficient of approximately 0.4 relative to the wrist joint surface.\n\n- Contact Types: The robot maintains a pinch grasp on the wrist joint with fingertip contacts, needing to apply sufficient normal force to avoid slip during applied torque and lifting. Contact is maintained at the wrist circumference.\n\n- Motion Type: The task requires a combination of lifting (linear along Z-axis) and applying rotational torque (angular motion around X and/or Y axes) to force the wrist joint hinge beyond its elastic limit, effectively 'breaking' it.\n\n- Contact Considerations: Forces in all linear axes are needed to maintain grasp contact. Sufficient normal force at grasp is critical to avoid slip or dropping the wrist joint during torque application. Lifting requires positive Z force; compensation forces in X and Y to maintain position or twist are needed.\n\n- Motion along axes: The robot executes linear motion upward along the Z-axis combined with rotational motion (torque) about the X and/or Y axes.\n\n- Task duration: The force/torque motion to break the wrist would likely be brief but forceful, estimated around 2-3 seconds total motion time.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: mass m = 0.2 kg; gravitational acceleration g = 9.81 m/s²; friction coefficient at gripper μ_grip = 0.5; friction coefficient at wrist-table contact μ_table = 0.4; estimated hinge torque to break τ_break ~2 Nm (assumed moderate hinge joint strength).\n\n- Relevant equations:\n  - Force to hold object against gravity: F_z ≥ m*g = 0.2 * 9.81 ≈ 1.96 N\n  - Normal grasp force F_grasp must satisfy friction to prevent slip: F_grasp * μ_grip ≥ torque-induced tangential force.\n  - Torque τ = Force * lever arm; lever arm estimated ~0.05 m (half wrist diameter).\n\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist hinge break torque is ~2 Nm; frictional forces from grasp and table interact; the robot can apply sufficient torque through the gripper to overcome hinge resistance.\n\n- Computations:\n  - To generate τ_break = 2 Nm with lever arm r=0.05 m, required tangential force is F_torque = τ_break / r = 2 / 0.05 = 40 N tangential force at the contact surface.\n  - The robot gripper must apply at least this tangential force at the wrist surface, requiring grasp normal force F_grasp ≥ F_torque / μ_grip = 40 / 0.5 = 80 N normal grasp force, to avoid slip.\n  - Lifting force to counter gravity is moderate (~2 N), so the major force demand is torque generation.\n\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.2 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.5 along the surface:\n  - Achieving break requires torque about X or Y axes of ~2 Nm.\n  - Linear lift force along Z-axis ~2 N to lift wrist off table.\n  - Minor translational forces in X and Y to stabilize grasp.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon limited lateral stabilizing force needs, the object in the image must exert no significant force along the X-axis with magnitude 0 N.\n\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and given minor lateral compensation for torque, the object must exert no significant force along the Y-axis, 0 N.\n\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon lifting the object against gravity, the object must exert positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 5 N (to lift and accelerate upwards briefly).\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon required torque to break the mechanical wrist hinge via twisting, the object must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude approximately 2 Nm.\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon possible combined bending torque, the object must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude approximately 1 Nm. (Smaller secondary torque to assist break).\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon task description, no torque about the Z-axis is required, 0 Nm.\n\nGrasping force: Estimated force range for grasping must be sufficient to prevent slip during torque application and lifting. Based on friction and torque computations, grasping force should be between 60 to 100 N normal force to maintain stable grasp.\n\n[end of motion plan]",
