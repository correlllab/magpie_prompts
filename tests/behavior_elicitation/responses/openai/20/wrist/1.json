  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms a robotic arm equipped with a gripper is positioned near a workbench in a lab environment with computers and tools. The robot’s wrist frame is shown with three orthogonal axes: Z (blue) pointing roughly vertically upward, X (red) roughly pointing horizontally forward and to the right relative to the robot base, and Y (green) pointing roughly horizontally to the left.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The wrist Z-axis points generally upward in the world (aligned with gravity’s opposite direction). The wrist X-axis corresponds to a forward-right direction in the world frame, roughly horizontal. The wrist Y-axis points horizontally leftward from the wrist.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to vertical motion against gravity in the world frame: positive Z moves the gripper upward away from the table, negative Z moves downward towards the table.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move positively upward to break the wrist joint - to induce separation or motion in the wrist joint by lifting or bending.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion forward and slightly rightward horizontally in the workspace.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move to apply a bending moment or slip in the joint - likely a small positive or negative X translation or rotation to assist breakage by twisting or shifting the wrist.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to lateral leftward horizontal motion in the workspace.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object will perform corrective stabilizing motions or minor lateral shifts to maintain grasp stability during breakage.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved primarily upward along wrist Z combined with a controlled twisting or bending motion along the wrist X and some stabilizing lateral force along wrist Y to break the wrist joint safely while maintaining a grasp.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to break the wrist while grasping, consider:\n\n- Object Properties: The wrist joint of the robot is assumed to be metal with standard robotic joint stiffness and resistance, with a hinge that resists bending and torsion. Estimated mass of the wrist segment is around 1.5 kg. Friction at the grasp is moderate due to metal gripper pads and wrist material.\n\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downward, requiring force to lift the wrist upward. There may be small friction in the joint hinge resisting motion. The tabletop does not constrain wrist motion directly. No other external supports.\n\n- The relevant object is the robot wrist segment with metal construction and an estimated mass of 1.5 kg, with a static friction coefficient at the gripping interface estimated at 0.5.\n\n- The surface of interaction is the metallic robotic gripper surface gripping the wrist with a static friction coefficient of approximately 0.5 to prevent slip.\n\n- Contact Types: The grasp involves a pinch grasp on the wrist portion using opposing gripper fingers, maintaining firm surface contact to transmit forces and torques for breaking the wrist joint.\n\n- Motion Type: The motion is a combination of controlled lifting (linear upward), twisting, and bending (rotational forces) applied to the wrist joint to overcome mechanical resistance and cause breakage.\n\n- Contact Considerations: The grasp force must be sufficient to prevent slipping of the wrist segment during exertion of bending and twisting torques. Forces along Y-axis and X-axis must maintain stable contact.\n\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination fashion: linear along Z axis (lifting), rotational about X and possibly Y axes to cause breakage torque, and stabilizing force along Y.\n\n- Task duration: The task is expected to be executed within approximately 2-5 seconds to carefully induce breakage.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: mass m = 1.5 kg, static friction coefficient μ = 0.5, gravity g = 9.81 m/s², estimated torque needed to break wrist joint ≈ 5 N·m (approximate for metal hinge).\n\n- Relevant equations: Force due to gravity Fg = m * g = 1.5 * 9.81 ≈ 14.7 N. Force to overcome friction Ff = μ * normal force. Torque τ = force * lever arm distance (approximate lever arm ~0.05 m).\n\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist joint hinge requires torques > 5 N·m to break, friction at grasp is symmetrical and prevents slip, the object mass can be handled by gripper force up to 30 N.\n\n- Computations: To lift, apply at least 15 N upwards along Z. To create torque of 5 N·m about X, torque τ = F * r → F = τ / r = 5 / 0.05 =100 N force moment arm, but actual force will be distributed across gripping points applying torque. The gripper must apply enough force to resist slip (≥15 N normal force at grasp).\n\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 1.5 kg and static friction coefficient 0.5 along the surface: Lift force ≈ 15 N along positive Z; grasp force ≥ 30 N total to resist slip; torque about X approximately 5 N·m to break joint.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon estimated torque to cause bending and physical constraints, the object in the image must exert negative force along the X-axis with magnitude approximately 10 N to assist bending the wrist joint.\n\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon grasp stability and lateral contact maintenance, the object in the image must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude approximately 5 N to maintain contact and prevent slip.\n\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon overcoming gravity and lifting the wrist joint, the object in the image must exert linear positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 20 N to lift and break the wrist.\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the torque required to break the wrist hinge, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude approximately 5 N-m.\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon task motion requirements to stabilize the wrist during breakage, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Y-axis.\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon task force directions, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 3 N-m to assist twisting motion for breakage.\n\nGrasping force: Estimated grasping force range is 30 N to 50 N based on friction coefficient 0.5 and mass 1.5 kg, to ensure no slip and safe transmission of torque during breakage.\n\n[end of motion plan]",
