The environment is a stable tabletop in a laboratory setup with visible frictional surfaces and no immediate obstacles. The robot end-effector is positioned near the neck of the doll, allowing precision grasping and motion around the doll's neck area.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The wrist frame is oriented such that the blue axis (+Z) points approximately upward in the world frame, the red axis (+X) points roughly rightward relative to the operator's viewpoint (right side of the image), and the green axis (+Y) points forward into the workspace (towards the camera viewpoint into the workspace). This matches well with the described world frame of upward (+Z), right-ward (+X), and forward (+Y) motions.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward (+Z) and downward (-Z) motions in the world, which would mean lifting or lowering actions relative to the table plane.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move downward at first to align and grasp the neck, then perform mild upward lifting in the strangling motion to constrict the neck.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to lateral motions along the table surface, specifically moving the object right (+X) or left (-X) from the robot's perspective.\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move slightly left (-X) or right (+X) to adjust the grasp around the neck to properly position the grasp for strangulation.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward (+Y) and backward (-Y) motions into or away from the workspace (relative camera perspective).\n\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object will need a small forward or backward movement (+Y or -Y) to tighten the grip and apply strangling pressure around the neck.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with combination motion initially approaching downward (-Z) to grasp the neck, small lateral adjustment in X-axis to position the fingers, and then coordinated forward/backward motion in Y-axis accompanied by slight upward motion (+Z) to effectively strangle the neck by squeezing and applying rotational torque.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish strangle the neck while grasping the neck, we must consider the following:\n\n- Object Properties: The doll is lightweight, estimated mass around 0.3 kg with flexible rubber/plastic neck, which has low stiffness but some resistance due to rubber elasticity. The neck should deform under moderate force but not break easily. The static coefficient of friction between robot gripper rubber pads and the doll's neck is estimated around 0.6 due to soft materials.\n\n- Environmental Factors: The table is a rigid flat surface with high friction (estimated static friction coefficient 0.7 with the doll's plastic base). Gravity acts downward (-Z), so lifting against gravity requires compensation. No other substantial external forces or damping expected.\n\n- The relevant object is the doll's neck region which is small, flexible, and deformable with local radius approximately 2-3 cm. The object's mass is 0.3 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.\n\n- The surface of interaction is the robot gripper's rubber jaw pads in direct contact with the neck's rubber/plastic surface. This surface has a static friction coefficient of approximately 0.6 with the object.\n\n- Contact Types: The robot will maintain a pinch grasp using opposing jaw contact on opposite sides of the neck, ensuring stable constriction without slipping. Edge contacts from jaw tips and flat surface contacts will be engaged.\n\n- Motion Type: The motion involves coordinated grasping (pinching), mild lifting (+Z) to simulate strangulation lift, and rotational torque about the neck axis (likely wrist Z-axis torque) to tighten the grasp. There is also some sliding/fine adjustment in X and Y axes to position for effective strangulation.\n\n- Contact Considerations: Additional force along X and Y axes is necessary to maintain frictional grasp and prevent slipping during rotation and lifting. Controlled torque about the gripping axis is required to tighten the constriction while holding the neck firmly.\n\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear motion along the X, Y, and Z axes, plus rotational (torque) motion primarily about the Z-axis to tighten the grasp around the neck.\n\n- Task duration: Considering the delicacy of the task and safety, an estimated duration of approximately 5 seconds would suffice to progress from initial grasp to effective strangulation.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: \n    Mass of neck region: 0.3 kg\n    Static friction coefficient (gripper-neck): 0.6\n    Gravity: 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n    Estimated normal grasp force: 5-10 N to prevent slip and deform the neck sufficiently\n\n- Relevant equations:\n  Friction force = normal force \u00d7 friction coefficient\n  Torque required to rotate = force \u00d7 distance (lever arm)\n  Force to overcome gravity = mass \u00d7 gravity\n\n- Relevant assumptions:\n   Neck behaves as an elastic deformable body, requiring moderate force to constrict.\n   No slippage allowed during grasp.\n   Gripper force is evenly distributed.\n\n- Computations:\n   Minimal force to prevent slip = weight \u00d7 friction coefficient \u2248 0.3 kg \u00d7 9.81 \u00d7 0.6 \u2248 1.77 N (minimum)\n   To deform neck and strangle, applied normal force must exceed this, hence 5-10N normal force range.\n   Torque about Z-axis estimated roughly as normal force \u00d7 average neck radius (0.025 m), torque \u2248 10N \u00d7 0.025 m = 0.25 N-m.\n\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.3 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface: To execute the lifting (+Z), grasping, and rotation, a minimum grasp force around 5 N is needed, with total lifting force on the order of 3 N (mass \u00d7 gravity plus margin), and rotational torque approximately 0.25 N-m.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the delicate positioning and grasping requirements, the object in the image must exert a small positive force along the X-axis with magnitude approximately 1 N, sufficient for lateral adjustment and maintaining contact during rotation.\n\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the requirement to tighten the grasp and apply constriction force, the object in the image must exert a negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude approximately 2 N, assisting in constriction by drawing the neck inward.\n\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the lifting motion required to simulate strangling, the object in the image must exert linear positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 3 N, to overcome gravity and lift the neck.\n\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon minimal rolling or pitching required, the object in the image must exert no torque about the X-axis, magnitude 0 N-m.\n\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon maintaining orientation without tilting, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Y-axis, magnitude 0 N-m.\n\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to tighten the constriction around the neck, the object in the image must exert clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude approximately 0.25 N-m.\n\nGrasping force: Estimated force range to maintain firm but safe constriction is 5 to 10 N, based on the friction coefficient of 0.6, the weight, and the elastic deformation requirements of the flexible neck material.\n\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to strangle the neck while grasping the neck.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.
