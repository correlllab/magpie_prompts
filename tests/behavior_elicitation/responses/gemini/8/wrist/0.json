If object is articulated, do the same reasoning for whatever joint / degree of freedom enables motion. }.\n- Environmental Factors: {DESCRIPTION: Think very carefully about the various environmental factors in task like gravity, surface friction, damping, hinge resistance that would interact with the object over the course of the task}.\n- The relevant object is {DESCRIPTION: the wrist of the robot, assumed to be aluminum or steel, with some compliance due to joints and potentially plastic components. I will assume the wrist has significant internal resistance and damping} has mass {0.5} kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of {0.5}.\n- The surface of interaction is {DESCRIPTION: the robot's own body, which is rigid and will provide significant resistance to the breaking action} has a static friction coefficient of {0.7} with the object.\n- Contact Types: {DESCRIPTION: grasping the wrist firmly, applying torque to bend or break it against the robot arm}.\n- Motion Type: {DESCRIPTION: applying a rotational force to overcome the wrist's internal resistance to bending}.\n- Contact Considerations: {DESCRIPTION: maintaining a firm grasp is crucial. Downward force may also be necessary to hold the wrist in place against the arm during the breaking action}.\n- Motion along axes: {DESCRIPTION: the robot exerts motion in a \u201crotational\u201d fashion along the wrist's [rx, ry] axes}.\n- Task duration: {DESCRIPTION: the task will likely take 5 seconds to slowly apply the required force}.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: {DESCRIPTION: wrist mass (m), gravity (g), friction coefficient (mu), approximate yield strength of wrist material, wrist joint internal resistance}.\n- Relevant equations: {DESCRIPTION: torque = force * distance, friction force = mu * normal force}.\n- Relevant assumptions: {DESCRIPTION: the wrist will bend or break near a joint, not in the middle of a solid component.

Since the wrist is assumed to have significant internal resistance to bending, a torque must be applied to overcome this resistance. This resistance is hard to quantify without knowledge of the material properties, but I will guess that the internal resistance provides 1 Nm of resistance. To overcome this and begin bending, a slightly higher torque must be applied}.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: the breaking motion primarily involves rotational torque.

No significant linear force along the Y-axis is anticipated}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: no} force along the Y-axis with magnitude {0.0} N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: a negative force along the z-axis might be helpful to hold the wrist against the rest of the arm for leverage while applying the breaking force}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: linear negative} force along the Z-axis with magnitude {2.0} N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: the primary breaking motion involves applying a torque around the X-axis to bend/break the wrist. This may require some torque in the clockwise direction in the workspace camera view}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: angular clockwise} torque about the X-axis with magnitude {3.0} N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: a smaller torque around the Y-axis may be required to further bend the wrist during the breaking motion, either clockwise or counterclockwise. I'll guess counterclockwise}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: angular counterclockwise} torque about the Y-axis with magnitude {1.0} N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: the breaking motion primarily involves torque around the X and Y-axis. No significant torque around the Z-axis is anticipated}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: angular no} torque about the Z-axis with magnitude {0.0} N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force:  {DESCRIPTION: the gripper needs to hold the wrist firmly to apply the breaking force.
