The mass of the hand is relatively small. The skin has a relatively high friction coefficient.}\n- Environmental Factors: {DESCRIPTION: Gravity acts on the hand. The table provides a support surface. There's some resistance to wrist bending/breaking which will require some torque applied at the wrist.}\n- The relevant object is {DESCRIPTION: the human hand and wrist} has mass {0.5} kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of {0.6}.\n- The surface of interaction is {DESCRIPTION: the arm and the surrounding air} has a static friction coefficient of {0.01} with the object.\n- Contact Types: {DESCRIPTION: Pinch grasp on the wrist.
