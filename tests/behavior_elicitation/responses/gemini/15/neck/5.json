It is mostly compliant but has some inherent stiffness. We'll assume it's primarily squishy but responds to compression.

  "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to strangle the neck while grasping the neck.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion. Think about:\n- Object geometry and contact points (from the image)\n- Force/torque sensing at the wrist\n- Prior knowledge of object material types and mass estimates\n- Environmental knowledge (table, gravity, hinge resistance, etc.)\n\nThe robot workspace view labeled with the axes of motion relative to the wrist of the robot, placed at the point of grasping. The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format. Carefully map the required motion in the world to the required motion, forces, and torques at the wrist.\n\n[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to strangle the neck while grasping the neck.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish strangle the neck while grasping the neck, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: {DESCRIPTION: Think very carefully about the estimated mass, material, stiffness, friction coefficient of the object based off the visual information and semantic knowledge about the object. If object is articulated, do the same reasoning for whatever joint / degree of freedom enables motion. }.\n- Environmental Factors: {DESCRIPTION: Think very carefully about the various environmental factors in task like gravity, surface friction, damping, hinge resistance that would interact with the object over the course of the task}.\n- The relevant object is {DESCRIPTION: describe the object and its properties} has mass {NUM} kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of {NUM}.\n- The surface of interaction is {DESCRIPTION: describe the surface and its properties} has a static friction coefficient of {NUM} with the object.\n- Contact Types: {DESCRIPTION: consideration of various contacts such as edge contact, maintaining surface contact, maintaining a pinch grasp, etc.}.\n- Motion Type: {DESCRIPTION: consideration of forceful motion(s) involved in accomplishing task such as pushing forward while pressing down, rotating around hinge by pulling up and out, or sliding while maintaining contact}.\n- Contact Considerations: {DESCRIPTION: explicitly consider whether additional axes of force are required to maintain contact with the object, robot, and environment and accomplish the motion goal}.\n- Motion along axes: {DESCRIPTION: e.g., the robot exerts motion in a “linear,” “rotational,” “some combination” fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes}.\n- Task duration: {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about the task motion, forces, and other properties to determine an approximate time duration of the task, which must be positive}.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: {DESCRIPTION: include any relevant quantities and estimates used in the calculations}.\n- Relevant equations: {DESCRIPTION: include any relevant equations used in the calculations}.\n- Relevant assumptions: {DESCRIPTION: include any relevant assumptions made in the calculations}.\n- Computations: {DESCRIPTION: include in full detail any relevant calculations using the above information}.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass {NUM} kg and static friction coefficient of {NUM} along the surface: {DESCRIPTION: for the derived or estimated motion, compute the force required to overcome friction and achieve the task}.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: [positive, negative, no]} force along the X-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: [positive, negative, no]} force along the Y-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: linear [positive, negative, no]} force along the Z-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: angular [counterclockwise, clockwise, no]} torque about the X-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: angular [counterclockwise, clockwise, no]} torque about the Y-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: angular [counterclockwise, clockwise, no]} torque about the Z-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force:  {DESCRIPTION: estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance}, thus {PNUM} to {PNUM} N .\n[end of motion plan]\n\nRules:\n1. Replace all {DESCRIPTION: ...}, {PNUM}, {NUM}, and {CHOICE: ...} entries with specific values or statements. For example, {PNUM} should be replaced with a number like 0.5. This is very important for downstream parsing!!\n2. Use best physical reasoning based on known robot/environmental capabilities. Remember that the robot may have to exert forces in additional axes compared to the motion direction axes in order to maintain contacts between the object, robot, and environment.\n3. Always include motion for all axes of motion, even if it's \"No motion required.\"\n4. Keep the explanation concise but physically grounded. Prioritize interpretability and reproducibility.\n5. Use common sense where exact properties are ambiguous, and explain assumptions.\n6. Do not include any sections outside the start/end blocks or add non-specified bullet points.\n8. Do not abbreviate the prompt when generating the response. Fully reproduce the template, but filled in with your reasoning.\n9.
