The 'man' is likely made of soft material like cloth or foam. The scissors have a pivot point which contributes to their functionality.}\n- Environmental Factors: {DESCRIPTION: Gravity acts on the scissors. The 'man' provides resistance upon stabbing due to its material properties.}\n- The relevant object is scissors, made of metal has mass 0.1 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.5.\n- The surface of interaction is the 'man', made of cloth/foam has a static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the object.\n- Contact Types: {DESCRIPTION: The robot will maintain a pinch grasp on the scissors.

Think about:\n- Object geometry and contact points (from the image)\n- Force/torque sensing at the wrist\n- Prior knowledge of object material types and mass estimates\n- Environmental knowledge (table, gravity, hinge resistance, etc.)\n\nThe robot workspace view labeled with the axes of motion relative to the wrist of the robot, placed at the point of grasping. The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format.
