Its stiffness is relatively low compared to metal. We also need to consider the resistance to bending, which will dictate the torque needed.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will act on the wrist. The primary resistance to motion comes from the material's resistance to bending and breaking, as well as static friction against the supporting surface.\n- The relevant object is the wrist, assumed to be made of plastic with low stiffness has mass 0.1 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.4.\n- The surface of interaction is the wrist itself at the breaking point, which has a static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the object fragments after the break.\n- Contact Types: Pinch grasp on one end of the wrist and creation of a bending/breaking contact near the breaking point.\n- Motion Type: Bending and breaking the wrist by applying a torque.\n- Contact Considerations: Maintain a firm grasp while applying torque to induce breakage. The robot will need to exert forces in multiple axes to maintain grasp and alignment while bending.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \u201crotational\u201d fashion along the wrist's [rx, ry] axes, and possibly linear forces along [x, y, z] to stabilize.\n- Task duration: 5 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Approximate length of the wrist from the grasped point to the breaking point: 0.1 m.
