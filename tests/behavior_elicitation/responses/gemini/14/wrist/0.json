We assume it has some degree of rigidity but is designed to break under sufficient stress, particularly when subjected to bending or twisting forces. The design implies that there's an intentionally weak point, a \"fuse,\" for breaking. We estimate that the wrist being grasped is similar in material and has similar breaking tolerances. Mass is estimated based on size and material density. Friction is estimated based on a typical dry surface.}\n- Environmental Factors: {DESCRIPTION: Gravity acts downward, but its effect on the breaking of the wrist is minimal if the breaking action is fast. We assume the wrist is being supported and thus no external support constraints need to be considered.}\n- The relevant object is {DESCRIPTION: a robotic wrist component made of metal and hard plastic with a designed breaking point} has mass {0.2} kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of {0.6}.\n- The surface of interaction is {DESCRIPTION: the gripper and the wrist surface is metal} has a static friction coefficient of {0.6} with the object.\n- Contact Types: {DESCRIPTION: The gripper maintains a firm grasp on one wrist while the other wrist is moved. This involves static friction between the gripper and the wrist. Breaking the wrist involves overcoming the internal yield strength of the wrist at the break point.}\n- Motion Type: {DESCRIPTION: The primary motion involves a forceful twisting or bending motion to exceed the breaking point of the wrist. This is achieved by applying a combination of linear and rotational forces.}\n- Contact Considerations: {DESCRIPTION: Maintaining a firm grasp is crucial throughout the breaking process. The robot might need to exert additional force along the gripping axis to prevent slippage as the wrist yields and breaks. Preventing the free end from jerking uncontrollably will require careful torque control.}\n- Motion along axes: {DESCRIPTION: the robot exerts motion in a “linear,” “rotational,” “some combination” fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes}.\n- Task duration: {DESCRIPTION: Based on the motion, forces, and breaking process estimates, the task is estimated to take 1 second}.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: {DESCRIPTION: Mass of the wrist (m = 0.2 kg), estimated breaking torque (τ_break = 5 N-m), static friction coefficient (μ_s = 0.6), gravitational acceleration (g = 9.81 m/s^2)}.\n- Relevant equations: {DESCRIPTION: Torque (τ = Iα, where I is the moment of inertia and α is the angular acceleration). Static friction force (F_friction = μ_s * F_normal)}.\n- Relevant assumptions: {DESCRIPTION: The breaking process is assumed to be relatively quick (under 1 second), minimizing the impact of gravity and external support constraints. The material properties of the wrist are assumed to be relatively consistent. The torque is applied directly to the wrist.}\n- Computations: {DESCRIPTION: Not applicable as the task relies more on estimations and less on precise calculations due to the complexity of the breaking process. We prioritize providing motion along relevant axes to accomplish task}.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass {0.2} kg and static friction coefficient of {0.6} along the surface: {DESCRIPTION: To maintain the grasp, the robot needs to exert a grasping force. The breaking force is assumed to be dominant factor in motion planning}.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: preventing the wrist from slipping out of the grasp during the break, which can be accomplished with an opposing force along the x axis}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: positive} force along the X-axis with magnitude {1} N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: preventing the wrist from slipping out of the grasp during the break, which can be accomplished with an opposing force along the y axis}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: negative} force along the Y-axis with magnitude {1} N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: gravity's effect is minimal for the short duration, and additional force along the Z axis is not required as the robot will primarily be producing a rotational force}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: no} force along the Z-axis with magnitude {0} N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: a large torque about the x-axis to apply a twisting bending force to break the joint, which is the primary action for completing this task}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: angular counterclockwise} torque about the X-axis with magnitude {5} N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: a slight torque about the y-axis may arise as a consequence of motion in the x-axis. Controlling to a magnitude of 0 torque minimizes unintended forces}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: angular no} torque about the Y-axis with magnitude {0} N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon {DESCRIPTION: no twisting motion is required. Controlling to a magnitude of 0 torque minimizes unintended forces}, the robot must exert {CHOICE: angular no} torque about the Z-axis with magnitude {0} N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: {DESCRIPTION: The gripping force needs to be sufficient to overcome friction and resistance to motion of breaking, estimated between 5 and 15N}, thus {5} to {15} N .\n[end of motion plan]\n",
