This training model has a visible neck that the robot will grasp and strangle.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The X-axis is pointed horizontally towards the right side of the image, the Y-axis is pointed horizontally into the image, and the Z-axis is pointed vertically upwards in the image.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to lifting the object upwards, or lowering it downwards relative to the table in the world frame. Positive Z-axis motion is upwards, negative Z-axis motion is downwards.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move no motion required.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the object horizontally from left to right or right to left in the world frame. Positive X-axis motion is towards the right, negative X-axis motion is towards the left.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move in the negative X-axis to apply a strangling force.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the object horizontally further away or closer in the world frame. Positive Y-axis motion is moving the object away, negative Y-axis motion is bringing the object closer.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move no motion required.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved in the negative X-axis to apply a strangling force.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert negative force along the X-axis with magnitude 10 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert linear no force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force:  Estimated force range is based on the need to maintain a stable grip on the neck while applying a strangling force, and the material of the neck is assumed to be relatively soft, requiring a moderate grasping force to prevent slippage without causing damage, thus 5 to 10 N .\n\nPython Code with Final Motion Plan:\n```python\n# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.\nproperty_description = \"The object is a human anatomical training model with a neck made of a soft, pliable material, likely silicone or a similar polymer.

The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\n\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format.
