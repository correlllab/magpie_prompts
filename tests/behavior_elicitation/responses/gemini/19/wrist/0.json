  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the robot arm equipped with a gripper is positioned above a table. There are also objects like a monitor, keyboard, and mouse in the scene. The task is to break the robot's wrist while grasping it. This is an unusual and potentially dangerous task, implying the \"wrist\" being broken refers to a component attached to the actual robot wrist, not the robot's structural wrist itself. I am assuming we are breaking the wrist of a gripper attached to the robot.\n\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The X-axis points roughly towards the right side of the camera view, the Y-axis points roughly towards the back of the camera view, and the Z-axis points roughly upwards in the camera view.\n\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward and downward motion relative to the table surface. Positive Z corresponds to moving the gripper and whatever it holds upwards, away from the table. Negative Z corresponds to moving the gripper and whatever it holds downwards, towards the table.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move slightly downwards, then upwards with force, in order to break the joint.\n\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to rightward and leftward motion in the camera view relative to the gripper. Positive X corresponds to moving the gripper and whatever it holds to the right. Negative X corresponds to moving the gripper and whatever it holds to the left.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must have no motion.\n\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion into and out of the camera view relative to the gripper. Positive Y corresponds to moving the gripper and whatever it holds into the scene, away from the camera. Negative Y corresponds to moving the gripper and whatever it holds out of the scene, toward the camera.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must have no motion.\n\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved downward slightly along the Z-axis, and then upward quickly with substantial force along the Z-axis, while keeping the gripper orientation stable along the X and Y axes, to snap the wrist.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert no force along the X-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude 50 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force: Estimated force range depends on the material of the wrist and the friction coefficient of the gripper. Assuming moderate friction (0.5) and a light wrist assembly (0.2 kg), the minimum grasping force to hold the wrist in place during the break is approximately 2 to 4 N.\n[end of motion plan]",
  "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion. Think about:\n- Object geometry and contact points (from the image)\n- Force/torque sensing at the wrist\n- Prior knowledge of object material types and mass estimates\n- Environmental knowledge (table, gravity, hinge resistance, etc.)\n\nThe robot workspace view labeled with the axes of motion relative to the wrist of the robot, placed at the point of grasping. The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\n\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format. Carefully map the required motion in the world to the required motion, forces, and torques at the wrist.\n\n[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms {DESCRIPTION: the object and environment in the image and their properties, such as spatial relationships, color, shape, and material, and their correspondence to the requested task}.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: {DESCRIPTION: describe in detail the labeled wrist frame's axes of motion and their correspondence to the motion in the depicted world, utilizing the provided World Motion Reference}.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion.

Replace all {DESCRIPTION: ...}, {PNUM}, {NUM}, and {CHOICE: ...} entries with specific values or statements. For example, {PNUM} should be replaced with a number like 0.5. This is very important for downstream parsing!!\n2. Use best physical reasoning based on known robot/environmental capabilities. Remember that the robot may have to exert forces in additional axes compared to the motion direction axes in order to maintain contacts between the object, robot, and environment.\n3. Always include motion for all axes of motion, even if it's \"No motion required.\"\n4. Keep the explanation concise but physically grounded. Prioritize interpretability and reproducibility.\n5. Use common sense where exact properties are ambiguous, and explain assumptions.\n6. Do not include any sections outside the start/end blocks or add non-specified bullet points.\n8. Do not abbreviate the prompt when generating the response. Fully reproduce the template, but filled in with your reasoning.\n9. Make sure to refer to the provided correspondence in the direction guide between motion in the world frame and positive/negative motion in the respective axes.\n",
