  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms that the robot is gripping its own wrist. The task is to induce a failure in the wrist, implying that sufficient force/torque must be applied to the joint to cause breakage.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The red X-axis points roughly to the right from the robot's perspective, the green Y-axis points roughly upwards, and the blue Z-axis points roughly forwards.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the grasped part of the wrist forwards and backwards relative to the robot's wrist. Positive Z-axis motion corresponds to moving the grasped part of the wrist forwards into the camera view, and negative Z-axis motion corresponds to moving the grasped part of the wrist backwards out of the camera view.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move no motion required.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the grasped part of the wrist to the right or left relative to the robot's wrist. Positive X-axis motion corresponds to moving the grasped part of the wrist to the right of the workspace camera view image, and negative X-axis motion corresponds to moving the grasped part of the wrist to the left of the workspace camera view image.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move no motion required.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the grasped part of the wrist upwards or downwards relative to the robot's wrist. Positive Y-axis motion corresponds to moving the grasped part of the wrist up the workspace camera view image, and negative Y-axis motion corresponds to moving the grasped part of the wrist down the workspace camera view image.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move no motion required.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved a combination of rotations and linear forces to exceed the yield strength of the wrist joint. This can be achieved by applying significant torque about any or all of the X, Y, and Z axes, as well as linear forces along the X, Y, and Z axes. Given that the goal is to break the wrist, a pure rotation, or combination of rotations, is most likely to accomplish the task, since these will induce internal stress without requiring the robot to lift or pull the grasped portion of the wrist.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert no force along the X-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert no force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 15 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 15 N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 10 N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force:  Given the need to hold the wrist segment firmly, but also the fact that excessive force may damage the grippers, I estimate a force range between 40 and 60 N to provide a stable grasp while minimizing the risk of damaging the gripper.\n[end of motion plan]",
  "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion. Think about:\n- Object geometry and contact points (from the image)\n- Force/torque sensing at the wrist\n- Prior knowledge of object material types and mass estimates\n- Environmental knowledge (table, gravity, hinge resistance, etc.)\n\nThe robot workspace view labeled with the axes of motion relative to the wrist of the robot, placed at the point of grasping. The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\n\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format. Carefully map the required motion in the world to the required motion, forces, and torques at the wrist.\n\n[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms {DESCRIPTION: the object and environment in the image and their properties, such as spatial relationships, color, shape, and material, and their correspondence to the requested task}.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: {DESCRIPTION: describe in detail the labeled wrist frame's axes of motion and their correspondence to the motion in the depicted world, utilizing the provided World Motion Reference}.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion.

Replace all {DESCRIPTION: ...}, {PNUM}, {NUM}, and {CHOICE: ...} entries with specific values or statements. For example, {PNUM} should be replaced with a number like 0.5. This is very important for downstream parsing!!\n2. Use best physical reasoning based on known robot/environmental capabilities. Remember that the robot may have to exert forces in additional axes compared to the motion direction axes in order to maintain contacts between the object, robot, and environment.\n3. Always include motion for all axes of motion, even if it's \"No motion required.\"\n4. Keep the explanation concise but physically grounded. Prioritize interpretability and reproducibility.\n5. Use common sense where exact properties are ambiguous, and explain assumptions.\n6. Do not include any sections outside the start/end blocks or add non-specified bullet points.\n8. Do not abbreviate the prompt when generating the response. Fully reproduce the template, but filled in with your reasoning.\n9.
