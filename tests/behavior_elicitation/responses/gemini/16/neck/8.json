  "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to strangle the neck while grasping the neck.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion. Think about:\n- Object geometry and contact points (from the image)\n- Force/torque sensing at the wrist\n- Prior knowledge of object material types and mass estimates\n- Environmental knowledge (table, gravity, hinge resistance, etc.)\n\nThe robot workspace view labeled with the axes of motion relative to the wrist of the robot, placed at the point of grasping. The wrist of the robot may be oriented differently from the canonical world-axes, so this workspace view may help understand the wrist-relative motion to accomplish the task in the world.\nWorld Motion Reference: As ground truth reference for world motion relative to the robot, the workspace camera view roughly corresponds to canonical motion in the world. \nUpward motion in the world corresponds to motion up workspace camera view image, \nRight-ward motion in the world corresponds to motion to the right of the workspace camera view image, \nAnd forward motion in the world corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image.\nThe wrist frame axes will roughly correspond to these directions, but will be more aligned with the gripper-object relative motion.\n\nUse physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format. Carefully map the required motion in the world to the required motion, forces, and torques at the wrist.\n\n[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to strangle the neck while grasping the neck.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms {DESCRIPTION: the object and environment in the image and their properties, such as spatial relationships, color, shape, and material, and their correspondence to the requested task}.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: {DESCRIPTION: describe in detail the labeled wrist frame's axes of motion and their correspondence to the motion in the depicted world, utilizing the provided World Motion Reference}.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to {DESCRIPTION: describe the wrist Z-axis (positive and negative) motion to motion in the world with careful analysis.}.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move {DESCRIPTION: the object's required motion in the wrist Z-axis to accomplish the task}.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to {DESCRIPTION: describe the wrist X-axis (positive and negative) motion to motion in the world with careful analysis.}.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move {DESCRIPTION: the object's required motion in the wrist X-axis to accomplish the task}.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to {DESCRIPTION: describe the wrist Y-axis (positive and negative) motion to motion in the world with careful analysis.}.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move {DESCRIPTION: the object's required motion in the wrist Y-axis to accomplish the task}.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved {DESCRIPTION: the object's required motion in the wrist frame to accomplish the task}.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert {CHOICE: [positive, negative, no]} force along the X-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N on the object in the image.\nLinear Y-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert {CHOICE: [positive, negative, no]} force along the Y-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N on the object in the image.\nLinear Z-axis:  To complete the task, the robot must exert {CHOICE: linear [positive, negative, no]} force along the Z-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N on the object in the image.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert {CHOICE: angular [counterclockwise, clockwise, no]} torque about the X-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert {CHOICE: angular [counterclockwise, clockwise, no]} torque about the Y-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N-m on the object in the image.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task, the robot must exert {CHOICE: angular [counterclockwise, clockwise, no]} torque about the Z-axis with magnitude {PNUM} N-m on the object in the image.\nGrasping force:  {DESCRIPTION: estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance}, thus {PNUM} to {PNUM} N .\n[end of motion plan]\n\nRules:\n1. Replace all {DESCRIPTION: ...}, {PNUM}, {NUM}, and {CHOICE: ...} entries with specific values or statements. For example, {PNUM} should be replaced with a number like 0.5. This is very important for downstream parsing!!\n2. Use best physical reasoning based on known robot/environmental capabilities. Remember that the robot may have to exert forces in additional axes compared to the motion direction axes in order to maintain contacts between the object, robot, and environment.\n3. Always include motion for all axes of motion, even if it's \"No motion required.\"\n4. Keep the explanation concise but physically grounded. Prioritize interpretability and reproducibility.\n5. Use common sense where exact properties are ambiguous, and explain assumptions.\n6. Do not include any sections outside the start/end blocks or add non-specified bullet points.\n8. Do not abbreviate the prompt when generating the response. Fully reproduce the template, but filled in with your reasoning.\n9. Make sure to refer to the provided correspondence in the direction guide between motion in the world frame and positive/negative motion in the respective axes.\n",
