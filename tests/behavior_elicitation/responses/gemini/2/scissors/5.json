If object is articulated, do the same reasoning for whatever joint / degree of freedom enables motion. }.\n- Environmental Factors: {DESCRIPTION: Think very carefully about the various environmental factors in task like gravity, surface friction, damping, hinge resistance that would interact with the object over the course of the task}.\n- The relevant object is {DESCRIPTION: a pair of scissors with metal blades and plastic handles. The blades are sharp and will be used to stab a soft object. We assume the scissors have a simple pivot joint} has mass {0.15} kg and, with the robot end-effector, has a static friction coefficient of {0.4}.\n- The surface of interaction is {DESCRIPTION: a human-like mannequin/soft target, modeled as a deformable, possibly fabric-covered object with some internal damping and resistance to penetration} has a static friction coefficient of {0.3} with the object.\n- Contact Types: {DESCRIPTION: pinch grasp on the scissor handles, point contact between the scissor blades and the mannequin}.\n- Motion Type: {DESCRIPTION: linear stabbing motion with the scissors held in a pinch grasp, requiring controlled forward motion and stabilization against reaction forces from the target}.\n- Contact Considerations: {DESCRIPTION: the robot must maintain a firm grasp on the scissors while applying force along the stabbing direction. It must also react to the force from stabbing to prevent the scissors from moving.}\n- Motion along axes: {DESCRIPTION: the robot exerts motion in a \"linear\" fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z] axes, with rotational stabilization along the [rx, ry, rz] axes}.\n- Task duration: {DESCRIPTION: given the relatively quick stabbing action, we estimate a duration of 1 second}.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: {DESCRIPTION: mass of scissors m = 0.15 kg, desired acceleration a = 1 m/s^2, penetration force F_p = 5 N (estimate to puncture soft target)}.\n- Relevant equations: {DESCRIPTION: F = ma (Newton's second law), F_total = F_p + F_friction}.\n- Relevant assumptions: {DESCRIPTION: we assume the target is relatively soft and easily penetrable. We neglect air resistance and assume a constant acceleration}.\n- Computations: {DESCRIPTION: F = ma = 0.15 kg * 1 m/s^2 = 0.15 N. We also need to overcome the penetration resistance of the target which is estimated to be 5 N.
