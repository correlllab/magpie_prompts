  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms that the robot wrist is near a tabletop. It is holding its own wrist. The goal is to break the robot's wrist while grasping it with its own gripper. This will likely require applying a significant bending moment to the wrist joint.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the wrist frame's axes of motion roughly correspond to the world axes, although there could be a slight rotation of the wrist frame.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward motion in the world with careful analysis. Negative Z motion would correspond to downward motion in the world.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move down to provide leverage when trying to break the wrist.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to rightward motion in the world with careful analysis. Negative X motion would correspond to leftward motion in the world.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move to the right of the workspace camera view image to provide leverage when trying to break the wrist.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view image with careful analysis. Negative Y motion would correspond to motion out of the workspace camera view image.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move back out of the workspace camera view image to provide leverage when trying to break the wrist.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved down, to the right, and out of the workspace camera view image.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The robot wrist itself is a complex assembly of metal and plastic components. Its mass is estimated to be around 1 kg. The material is stiff. The static friction coefficient between the gripper and the wrist is estimated to be 0.5. The wrist's joint stiffness will resist the breaking force.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will act on the wrist, but this is a relatively minor factor. The primary resistance will be the structural integrity of the wrist joint itself.\n- The relevant object is the robot wrist which is to be broken, its structural integrity is high has mass 1 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.5.\n- The surface of interaction is the robot wrist with the robot gripper has a static friction coefficient of 0.5 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The gripper maintains a pinch grasp on the wrist.\n- Motion Type: The motion involves applying a significant bending moment to the wrist joint to cause it to break. This will involve a combination of linear and rotational motions.\n- Contact Considerations: It's important to maintain a firm grasp on the wrist while applying the breaking force. The force applied in breaking the wrist is high.\n- Motion along axes: the robot exerts motion in a “some combination” fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes.\n- Task duration: Estimated 10 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist mass = 1 kg, gripper friction coefficient = 0.5, estimated breaking force of wrist = 500 N, estimated lever arm = 0.1 m.\n- Relevant equations: Torque = Force * Lever Arm\n- Relevant assumptions: The breaking force is a rough estimate based on the material properties and the size of the wrist joint.\n- Computations: Torque = 500 N * 0.1 m = 50 N-m\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 1 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.5 along the surface: To overcome friction and maintain the grasp, a force of at least 4.9 N (1 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 0.5) needs to be applied.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon lever motion analysis, the object in the image must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 10 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon lever motion analysis, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 10 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon lever motion analysis, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 10 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon lever motion analysis, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 20 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon lever motion analysis, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 50 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon lever motion analysis, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nGrasping force: Estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 50 to 100 N .\n[end of motion plan]",
