The task requires the robot to break its own wrist while grasping it. This is only possible if the robot's wrist mechanism can withstand a certain torque before failing.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the wrist frame is positioned near the robot's end-effector, indicating the directions of possible motion relative to the gripper. The wrist axes are aligned such that positive Z points upwards, positive Y points to the left, and positive X points away from the user (into the image).\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward and downward motion in the world with careful analysis. Positive Z corresponds to upward motion, while negative Z corresponds to downward motion.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move no motion is required in the Z-axis to accomplish the task.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion.

The most feasible way to break the wrist joint is to apply a large torque around the X or Y axis.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The robot wrist is likely made of metal or hard plastic, with some internal gears/motors. We assume it has a moderate stiffness. The mass of the grasped part of the wrist is likely around 0.5 kg. The coefficient of friction between the gripper and the wrist is estimated to be 0.6.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts on the grasped part of the wrist. The internal resistance of the wrist joint also opposes the applied torque.\n- The relevant object is the robot wrist has mass 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.\n- The surface of interaction is the gripper, which has a static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the object.\n- Contact Types: Pinch grasp on the wrist.\n- Motion Type: Rotational motion to apply torque.\n- Contact Considerations: Maintain a firm grasp.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \u201crotational\u201d fashion along the wrist's [rx, ry] axes.\n- Task duration: Approximately 5 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass of wrist = 0.5 kg; estimated breaking torque = 50 Nm.\n- Relevant equations: Torque = Force x Distance.\n- Relevant assumptions: The breaking torque of the wrist is within the robot's capabilities.\n- Computations: To achieve 50 Nm torque, assuming a moment arm of 0.1 meters (distance from the axis of rotation to the point where force is applied), the force required is 500 N. The friction force needed to maintain grip is Grip force * friction coefficient > force applied. So we need a minimum of 500 / 0.6 grip force or around 833N\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply primarily rotational force, the object in the image must exert no force along the X-axis with magnitude 0.0 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply primarily rotational force, the object in the image must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0.0 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply primarily rotational force, the object in the image must exert no force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply a large torque to break the wrist, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 50.0 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply a large torque to break the wrist, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to avoid rotation around the z axis during the break motion, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0.0 N-m.\nGrasping force: estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 850.0 to 900.0 N .\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.
