  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the existence of a robot arm with a two-finger gripper. The gripper is presumably grasping the wrist, but the wrist is not visible. The goal is to break the wrist, implying we will apply force to exceed its structural limits. The robot arm is situated in a laboratory-like environment with various objects such as a computer monitor, keyboard, and a table.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the provided frame shows the wrist's coordinate frame, which is helpful for understanding motion relative to the gripper.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion upwards in the workspace camera view. Positive motion in the wrist Z-axis corresponds to moving the grasped object (wrist) upwards relative to the robot's gripper. Negative motion in the wrist Z-axis corresponds to moving the grasped object (wrist) downwards relative to the robot's gripper.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move upwards with some small oscillations/vibrations to induce stress at the joint.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right in the workspace camera view. Positive motion in the wrist X-axis corresponds to moving the grasped object (wrist) to the right relative to the robot's gripper. Negative motion in the wrist X-axis corresponds to moving the grasped object (wrist) to the left relative to the robot's gripper.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move forward and back with some small oscillations/vibrations to induce stress at the joint.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion into the workspace camera view. Positive motion in the wrist Y-axis corresponds to moving the grasped object (wrist) away from the camera. Negative motion in the wrist Y-axis corresponds to moving the grasped object (wrist) toward the camera.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move in and out with some small oscillations/vibrations to induce stress at the joint.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with oscillatory motion in all three linear axes (X, Y, and Z) to induce stress at the wrist joint.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: Assume the wrist is composed of metal (likely aluminum or steel) and plastic. We can assume a moderate stiffness prior to breakage, and a relatively high static friction coefficient between the gripper and the wrist surfaces. The exact mass of the wrist is unknown.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will act on the wrist, but its effect will be relatively small compared to the forces needed to break it. We also have the damping from the environment to consider.\n- The relevant object is the robot wrist, assumed to be made of metal and plastic, with complex internal mechanics. This is assumed to be the point of breakage.\nThe relevant object is the wrist and has mass 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.\n- The surface of interaction is the robot gripper surface, assumed to be rubber-coated has a static friction coefficient of 0.6 with the object.\n- Contact Types: Pinch grasp will be maintained throughout the task.\n- Motion Type: Primarily oscillatory/vibrational motion in all three linear axes (X, Y, and Z) to apply cyclical stress.\n- Contact Considerations: Grasp force must be sufficient to prevent slippage during the applied oscillatory motion.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \"linear,\" \"rotational,\" \"some combination\" fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes.\n- Task duration: The approximate time duration of the task is 15 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist mass = 0.5 kg (estimated), target acceleration for oscillations = 5 m/s^2 (estimated).\n- Relevant equations: F = ma (Newton's second law).\n- Relevant assumptions: The wrist's structural integrity is sufficient to withstand static loads but will fail under cyclical stress.\n- Computations: Force required for X-axis oscillation: F_x = m * a = 0.5 kg * 5 m/s^2 = 2.5 N. Force required for Y-axis oscillation: F_y = m * a = 0.5 kg * 5 m/s^2 = 2.5 N. Force required for Z-axis oscillation: F_z = m * a = 0.5 kg * 5 m/s^2 = 2.5 N.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface: Force to overcome static friction would be approximately 0.6 * 0.5 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 2.94 N. However, we are not moving along a surface, but oscillating in free space. The key is overcoming the wrist's internal resistance to motion to eventually cause failure.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon estimated mass and acceleration, the object in the image must exert positive and negative force along the X-axis with magnitude 2.5 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon estimated mass and acceleration, the object in the image must exert positive and negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 2.5 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon estimated mass and acceleration, the object in the image must exert positive and negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 2.5 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to induce rotational stress, the object in the image must exert counterclockwise and clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 1.0 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to induce rotational stress, the object in the image must exert counterclockwise and clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 1.0 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to induce rotational stress, the object in the image must exert counterclockwise and clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 1.0 N-m.\nGrasping force: Estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 10 to 20 N .\n[end of motion plan]",
