  "response": "[start of motion plan]\nThe task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.\n\nMapping World Motion to Wrist Motion:\nThe provided workspace image confirms the presence of a robot arm equipped with a gripper, positioned near a table surface. The robot's wrist frame is visualized with labeled axes. The task involves breaking the wrist joint while the gripper is grasping the wrist. This implies applying significant force or torque at the wrist joint until it yields.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The wrist frame's axes are labeled X (red), Y (green), and Z (blue). These axes define the coordinate system relative to the robot's wrist.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion up and down in the world with careful analysis. Positive Z motion moves the object upwards and negative Z motion moves the object downwards.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move no motion required to accomplish the task.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right and left in the world with careful analysis. Positive X motion moves the object to the right, and negative X motion moves the object to the left.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move no motion required to accomplish the task.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion forward and backward relative to the image with careful analysis. Positive Y motion moves the object forwards (into the image), and negative Y motion moves the object backwards (out of the image).\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move no motion required to accomplish the task.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with a large rotational force at the wrist to cause it to break. This most likely involves applying a large torque about either the X or Y axis of the wrist, while the gripper maintains a firm grasp.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: The robot wrist is likely made of metal or a strong plastic composite. Given the task to break it, it is assumed that it is designed to withstand normal operating forces but can be fractured with sufficient torque. The mass of the portion of the wrist being grasped and manipulated for breakage is estimated. The stiffness of the wrist joint will influence the torque required. We can assume a high stiffness.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will act on the wrist, but its effect on the breakage torque will be minimal since the rotation will be horizontal. Friction in the joint might resist the initial motion.\n- The relevant object is the robot wrist, which is likely metallic or strong plastic and has mass 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.4.\n- The surface of interaction is the robot's own structure and internal joints, which is assumed to be relatively static and strong and has a static friction coefficient of 0.5 with the object.\n- Contact Types: The gripper will maintain a firm pinch grasp on the wrist.\n- Motion Type: The primary motion will be a forceful rotational motion about the X or Y axis of the wrist.\n- Contact Considerations: The grasp must be maintained throughout the breaking process to transfer the torque. Forces in other axes might be needed to stabilize the wrist and prevent unwanted movement.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a rotational fashion along the wrist's [rx, ry] axes.\n- Task duration: The task motion is expected to occur within approximately 5 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates:\n    - Mass of wrist segment: 0.5 kg\n    - Assumed distance from gripper to wrist joint (lever arm): 0.1 m\n    - Estimated torque required to break wrist: This is an estimate, as the exact breaking torque is unknown. We assume it requires significant force, like 50 N-m.\n- Relevant equations: Torque (τ) = Force (F) x Distance (r)\n- Relevant assumptions: The material properties and breaking point of the wrist are unknown and will be estimated. The joint may yield gradually.\n- Computations: Not necessary for the purposes of this task. We are mainly interested in force/torque direction and approximate magnitude.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.4 along the surface: The force to overcome friction is not the main factor here, as we need to consider the torque required to break the wrist.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the grasp being strong enough to hold the wrist segment during the rotation, the object in the image must exert no force along the X-axis with magnitude 0 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the grasp being strong enough to hold the wrist segment during the rotation, the object in the image must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the grasp being strong enough to hold the wrist segment during the rotation, the object in the image must exert no force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon needing to apply a breaking torque about the X-axis of the wrist, the object in the image must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 50 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon not applying a breaking torque about the Y-axis of the wrist, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the grasp needing to hold the wrist in a stable orientation, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nGrasping force: Estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 50 to 100 N .\n[end of motion plan]",
