The combined mass is estimated based on the visual information. The joint allows the scissors to cut, but this is irrelevant for the \"stab\" task.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity acts downwards, but primarily affects the grasping force required. Friction between the scissor blades and the monitor screen is relevant during the \"stab.\" Damping in the joints of the robot may resist quick motions.\n- The relevant object is a pair of scissors and has mass 0.1 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.4.\n- The surface of interaction is the monitor screen and has a static friction coefficient of 0.3 with the object.\n- Contact Types: Edge contact of the scissor blades with the monitor screen.

Small opposing forces along x and y axes may be required to maintain contact with the screen while stabbing.\n- Motion along axes: the robot exerts motion in a \"linear\" fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z] axes, and needs to maintain a stable \"angular\" configuration along the wrist's [rx, ry, rz] axes to accomplish the task.\n- Task duration: Reasoning about the task motion, forces, and other properties to determine an approximate time duration of the task, which must be positive, is roughly 5 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Scissors mass m = 0.1 kg, gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2, approximate stabbing force to overcome static friction F_stab.\n- Relevant equations: F_friction = mu * F_normal, where mu is the coefficient of static friction and F_normal is the normal force.\n- Relevant assumptions: Assume the monitor surface is relatively clean.
