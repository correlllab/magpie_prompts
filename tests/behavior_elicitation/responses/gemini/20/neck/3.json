The robot gripper is positioned above a table, ready to interact with objects on the table. The task is to strangle the neck while grasping the neck, which implies that we have to assume the presence of a neck object.\nThe labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The wrist frame is aligned such that its X, Y, and Z axes roughly correspond to the right, up, and forward directions relative to the workspace camera view.\nThe blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion into and out of the workspace camera view. Positive Z motion moves the gripper and any grasped object further into the scene, away from the robot. Negative Z motion moves the gripper and any grasped object closer to the robot, out of the scene.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move no significant distance along the Z-axis.\nThe red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right and left within the workspace camera view. Positive X motion moves the gripper and any grasped object to the right within the scene. Negative X motion moves the gripper and any grasped object to the left within the scene.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move to the right or left to accomplish the strangle, corresponding to either positive or negative X motion depending on initial positioning.\nThe green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion up and down within the workspace camera view. Positive Y motion moves the gripper and any grasped object upwards within the scene. Negative Y motion moves the gripper and any grasped object downwards within the scene.\nBased off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move no significant distance along the Y-axis.\nTo accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved to the right or left relative to the neck object while maintaining a grasp.\n\nUnderstanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\nTo estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish strangle the neck while grasping the neck, we must consider the following:\n- Object Properties: Assume the neck is made of plastic and hollow, with an estimated mass of 0.1 kg. Assume it is relatively flexible and easily deformed. Assume the diameter of the neck is around 5cm. The friction between the gripper and the neck is moderate, about 0.6.\n- Environmental Factors: Gravity will act on the neck. The surface the neck is resting on will exert a normal force. There may be friction between the neck and the surface.\n- The relevant object is the neck, assumed to be plastic and hollow has mass 0.1 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6.\n- The surface of interaction is the table surface, which is assumed to be a smooth, possibly coated, wood surface that has a static friction coefficient of 0.4 with the object.\n- Contact Types: Maintaining a pinch grasp on the neck while applying a strangling force.\n- Motion Type: The motion is a combination of grasping and then applying a lateral strangling motion.\n- Contact Considerations: The robot must apply sufficient force to maintain a secure grip on the neck to prevent slippage during strangulation. It may have to apply a slight downward force to maintain contact with the table and counteract any upward force from the strangling motion.\n- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a \u201clinear\u201d fashion along the wrist's [x] axis, and it must maintain a grasp with appropriate force along the gripper's closing axis.\n- Task duration: Assuming the strangling motion takes around 5 seconds.\n\nPhysical Model (if applicable):\n- Relevant quantities and estimates: Object mass (m = 0.1 kg), coefficient of static friction between gripper and neck (\u00b5 = 0.6), gravitational acceleration (g = 9.81 m/s^2).\n- Relevant equations: Force of friction Ff = \u00b5 * N, where N is the normal force. Force due to gravity Fg = m * g.\n- Relevant assumptions: The neck is relatively lightweight and will require a gripping force sufficient to overcome any slippage during the strangling motion.\n- Computations:\n    - Force due to gravity on the neck: Fg = 0.1 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 0.981 N.\n    - Assuming a desired safety factor of 2, the gripper must exert a force great enough to resist any downward force due to the motion: F_grip > Fg * safety factor, or F_grip > 1.962 N.\n    - An additional estimated force of 1 N is needed to pull and \u201cstrangle\u201d the neck.\n- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.1 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.6 along the surface: The required grip force is approximately 2 to 4 N to prevent slippage. The strangling action is mainly along the X-axis. Assuming the neck has a diameter of 0.05m, then F = ma. For a strangle duration of 5 seconds, let a = 0.01m/s^2, then F = 0.1*0.01 = 0.001 N. Since the force to \u201cstrangle\u201d the neck requires the most force, we\u2019ll set the force for moving along the X-axis to 1N.\n\nWrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\nLinear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to \"strangle\" by applying lateral force, the object in the image must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 1 N.\nLinear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the grasping and strangling requiring minimal vertical displacement, the object in the image must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N.\nLinear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the strangling requiring minimal depth displacement, the object in the image must exert no force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N.\nAngular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the strangling requiring minimal angular displacement about the X-axis, the object in the image must exert no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nAngular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the strangling requiring minimal angular displacement about the Y-axis, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nAngular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the strangling requiring minimal angular displacement about the Z-axis, the object in the image must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m.\nGrasping force: estimated force range and justification based on friction, mass, resistance, thus 2 to 4 N .\n[end of motion plan]", "message": "\nGiven the user instruction and an image of the robot workspace, generate a structured physical plan for a robot end-effector interacting with the environment.\nThe task is to strangle the neck while grasping the neck.\n\nThe robot is controlled using position and torque-based control, with access to contact feedback and 6D motion capabilities. \nMotions can include grasping, lifting, pushing, tapping, sliding, rotating, or any interaction with objects or surfaces.\nMotion can resolve across multiple axes, so be careful to consider all axes of motion to accomplish the task.\n\nReason about the provided and implicit information in the images and task description to generate a structured plan for the robot's motion.
