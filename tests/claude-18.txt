The task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.

Understanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:
To estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:
- Object Properties: The robot wrist appears to be a mechanical joint made of metal and plastic components, with moderate stiffness but designed with a breaking point to prevent damage to the rest of the robot. The wrist joint likely has a maximum torque rating beyond which it will break.
- Environmental Factors: The robot is positioned on a wooden table surface. Gravity will act downward, creating potential leverage if forces are applied perpendicular to the wrist axis. There are no apparent external constraints on the wrist movement.
- The relevant object is the robot's own wrist joint, which is a mechanical component consisting of metal and plastic parts, has mass 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.
- The surface of interaction is a wooden table with a smooth finish has a static friction coefficient of 0.35 with the object.
- Contact Types: The robot will need to maintain a firm grasp on its own wrist while applying torque beyond the breaking threshold.
- Motion Type: This task requires applying rotational force (torque) to exceed the breaking threshold of the wrist joint, likely by rotating around one or more axes while maintaining a firm grasp.
- Contact Considerations: The robot must maintain a secure grip on its wrist while applying the breaking torque. This may require additional forces along certain axes to prevent slippage during the breaking motion.
- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a primarily rotational fashion along the wrist's rx and ry axes, with some linear force to maintain grip stability.
- Task duration: Based on the need to apply a sudden, strong torque to break the wrist joint, the task should take approximately 2.0 seconds to complete.

Physical Model (if applicable):
- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist breaking threshold estimated at 15 N-m based on typical robotic wrist specifications.
- Relevant equations: Torque (τ) = Force (F) × Lever arm distance (r)
- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has a designed breaking point that can be triggered by exceeding a specific torque threshold. The robot has sufficient strength to generate the required breaking torque.
- Computations: Assuming a lever arm of approximately 0.1 m (distance from grip point to rotational axis), and a breaking torque of 15 N-m, the required force would be F = τ/r = 15 N-m / 0.1 m = 150 N.
- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.3 along the surface: To maintain grip during breaking, a gripping force of at least 50 N is required to prevent slippage when applying the breaking torque.

Wrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:
Linear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist during breaking, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 40.0 N on the object in the image.
Linear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 20.0 N on the object in the image.
Linear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to provide downward pressure to stabilize the wrist during breaking, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 30.0 N on the object in the image.
Angular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply torque beyond the wrist's breaking threshold around the X-axis, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 18.0 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply combined torque to exceed the breaking threshold, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 12.0 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the minimal contribution of Z-axis rotation to the breaking process, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 3.0 N-m on the object in the image.
Grasping force: Based on the need to maintain a secure grip during high-torque application and prevent slippage when applying breaking forces, thus 50.0 to 80.0 N.

The task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.

Understanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:
To estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:
- Object Properties: The robot wrist appears to be a mechanical joint made of metal components with a moderate level of rigidity. The wrist joint likely has internal mechanical stops and is designed to operate within certain rotational limits.
- Environmental Factors: The wrist is part of the robot arm system visible in the image. Gravity will act downward on the wrist components. The breaking action will encounter resistance from the internal mechanical structure of the wrist.
- The relevant object is the robot's own wrist joint, which is a mechanical component designed to allow controlled rotation has mass 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.
- The surface of interaction is the internal mechanism of the wrist joint which has metal-on-metal contact points has a static friction coefficient of 0.2 with the object.
- Contact Types: The robot will need to maintain a firm grasp on its own wrist while applying torque beyond the wrist's designed operational limits.
- Motion Type: This task requires applying excessive rotational force (torque) to the wrist joint beyond its mechanical limits, likely requiring rotation around one or more axes while maintaining a secure grasp.
- Contact Considerations: The robot must maintain a secure grip on the wrist while applying the breaking torque. This requires sufficient grasping force perpendicular to the intended rotation direction.
- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a primarily rotational fashion along the wrist's rx, ry, or rz axes, depending on which axis offers the least resistance to breaking.
- Task duration: Based on the mechanical resistance and the force required to break the wrist, this task would take approximately 2.0 seconds to complete.

Physical Model (if applicable):
- Relevant quantities and estimates: Estimated wrist breaking torque threshold of 15 N-m, wrist component mass of 0.5 kg, and grasp force of 40 N.
- Relevant equations: Torque = Force × Distance from pivot point.
- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has a mechanical stop or limitation that can be overcome with sufficient torque. Breaking refers to exceeding the mechanical limits rather than complete destruction.
- Computations: Assuming a lever arm of approximately 0.05 m from the wrist joint center to the point of force application, and a breaking threshold of 15 N-m, the required force would be 15 N-m ÷ 0.05 m = 300 N.
- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.2 along the surface: The friction force would be negligible compared to the internal mechanical resistance of the wrist joint. The primary consideration is overcoming the mechanical stops or limits within the joint structure.

Wrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:
Linear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert no force along the X-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.
Linear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.
Linear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert no force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.
Angular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical structure of the wrist joint which appears to have its primary rotation limits around this axis, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 20 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need for secondary rotational force to create a combined breaking motion, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 5 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain rotational stability in this axis while breaking occurs in the other axes, the robot must exert no torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.
Grasping force: The robot needs sufficient force to maintain a secure grip during the application of breaking torque without slipping, considering the wrist's metal surface and the forces involved in breaking, thus 40 to 60 N.

The task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.

Understanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:
To estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:
- Object Properties: The robot wrist appears to be a mechanical joint made of metal components with a limited range of motion. It likely has moderate stiffness with a breaking point that can be reached through excessive torque application. The wrist joint connects the end-effector (gripper) to the robot arm.
- Environmental Factors: The robot is positioned on a wooden table with moderate friction. Gravity will be acting downward. The wrist joint likely has internal resistance mechanisms and mechanical stops to prevent damage during normal operation.
- The relevant object is the robot's own wrist joint which has mass approximately 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.
- The surface of interaction is the internal bearing surfaces of the wrist joint which has a static friction coefficient of 0.1 with the moving components.
- Contact Types: The task requires self-interaction where the robot gripper must grasp its own wrist firmly enough to apply breaking force.
- Motion Type: This task requires applying rotational force beyond the mechanical limits of the wrist joint while maintaining a firm grasp. This would involve applying excessive torque in directions that exceed the joint's designed range of motion.
- Contact Considerations: The gripper must maintain a secure grasp on the wrist while applying rotational force. Additional downward force may be needed to prevent the gripper from slipping during the application of breaking torque.
- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear and rotational fashion, primarily focusing on rotational motion around the y-axis (rx) and z-axis (rz) of the wrist to exceed mechanical limits.
- Task duration: Based on the force required to break the wrist joint and the robot's torque capabilities, this task would take approximately 3 seconds to complete.

Physical Model (if applicable):
- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist joint breaking torque estimated at 15 N-m, gripper maximum grasp force of 100 N, coefficient of friction between gripper and wrist of 0.3.
- Relevant equations: Torque = Force × Distance; Friction force = Normal force × Coefficient of friction.
- Relevant assumptions: The wrist joint has a maximum torque rating that can be exceeded to cause mechanical failure. The gripper can apply sufficient force to maintain grasp during the breaking motion.
- Computations: To break the wrist joint rated for 15 N-m, with a moment arm of approximately 0.05 m, we need to apply a force of 15 N-m / 0.05 m = 300 N. To maintain grip with friction coefficient of 0.3, we need normal force of at least 300 N / 0.3 = 1000 N, which exceeds the gripper's capability, so we must rely on form-closure grasping as well.
- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.3 along the surface: The force needed to overcome friction would be 0.5 kg × 9.8 m/s² × 0.3 = 1.47 N, which is negligible compared to the forces needed to break the joint.

Wrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:
Linear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist during breaking, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 50 N on the object in the image.
Linear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain the wrist position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 20 N on the object in the image.
Linear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to provide downward pressure to secure the grip, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 100 N on the object in the image.
Angular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical structure of the wrist joint which likely has limited rotation in this axis, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 10 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon exploiting the wrist joint's mechanical limits, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 15 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the wrist's rotational vulnerability, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 15 N-m on the object in the image.
Grasping force: Based on the need to maintain a secure grip while applying breaking torques and overcoming the wrist's mechanical resistance, a firm grasp is essential to prevent slippage, thus 80 to 100 N.

The task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.

Understanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:
To estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:
- Object Properties: The robot wrist appears to be a mechanical joint made of metal and plastic components. It likely has moderate stiffness with internal mechanical components that have breaking points. The wrist joint likely has a yield strength designed for normal operation but can fail under excessive torque or force beyond its specifications.
- Environmental Factors: Gravity will act downward on the wrist components. The wrist is part of a robotic arm system that is mounted on what appears to be a wooden workbench. The breaking action will need to overcome the internal structural integrity of the wrist mechanism.
- The relevant object is the robot's wrist joint, which is a mechanical assembly connecting the arm to the end-effector/gripper. It has mass approximately 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.
- The surface of interaction is the internal structure of the wrist joint itself, which has metal-on-metal and possibly plastic-on-metal contacts with a static friction coefficient of 0.2 with the object.
- Contact Types: The robot will need to maintain a firm grasp on the wrist while applying breaking forces. This requires a pinch grasp with sufficient force to prevent slippage during the application of breaking torque.
- Motion Type: Breaking the wrist will likely require a combination of rotational forces (torques) applied perpendicular to the main axis of the wrist joint, while maintaining a firm grasp. This would typically involve rotating around one axis while pulling/pushing in another direction to create shearing forces that exceed the structural limits.
- Contact Considerations: The gripper must maintain sufficient grasping force throughout the breaking motion to prevent slippage. Additional downward force may be needed to stabilize the breaking action against the workbench surface.
- Motion along axes: The robot will exert motion in a combination of linear and rotational forces along the wrist's x, y, z, rx, ry, and rz axes, with primary breaking forces being rotational.
- Task duration: Based on the structural properties of typical robot wrists, applying sufficient breaking force would require approximately 3 seconds of sustained force application.

Physical Model (if applicable):
- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist joint yield strength approximately 15-20 N·m, wrist mass 0.5 kg, breaking torque needs to exceed yield strength.
- Relevant equations: Torque = Force × Distance from axis; Friction force = Normal force × Friction coefficient.
- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has a weakest point that will fail first when excessive torque is applied. The gripper can apply sufficient force to maintain grasp during breaking.
- Computations: To break a typical robot wrist joint, we need to exceed its yield strength of approximately 15-20 N·m. With a lever arm of approximately 0.05 m (distance from grasp point to axis of rotation), we need a force of at least 300-400 N applied perpendicular to the lever arm.
- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.3 along the surface: The minimum gripping force needed to prevent slippage during breaking would be F = (Breaking force)/(Friction coefficient) = 400 N / 0.3 = approximately 1333 N of grip force, which is extremely high and likely beyond the gripper's capabilities. Therefore, the gripper will need to establish a form-closure grasp where mechanical interlocking prevents slippage.

Wrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:
Linear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create leverage for breaking, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 50 N on the object in the image.
Linear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist during breaking, the robot must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 30 N on the object in the image.
Linear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply downward pressure to secure the wrist against the workbench, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 40 N on the object in the image.
Angular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical structure of typical robot wrists having weakness to lateral bending, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 18 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create twisting motion perpendicular to the wrist's primary rotation axis, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 15 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply torsional stress to the wrist joint, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 12 N-m on the object in the image.
Grasping force: Based on preventing slippage during high-torque application and the need to mechanically interlock with the wrist structure, thus 100 to 150 N.

The task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.

Understanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:
To estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:
- Object Properties: The robot wrist appears to be a mechanical joint made of metal components, likely aluminum or steel, with moderate stiffness. The wrist joint has a limited range of motion and mechanical stops that prevent over-rotation. Breaking the wrist likely refers to exceeding these mechanical limits.
- Environmental Factors: The robot is positioned on a wooden table in a laboratory environment. Gravity will act downward, and the table provides a stable base. The robot arm appears to be a collaborative robot with safety features.
- The relevant object is the robot's own wrist joint, which is a mechanical assembly connecting the arm to the end-effector, has mass 0.8 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.
- The surface of interaction is the internal mechanical components of the wrist joint which has a static friction coefficient of 0.15 with the object.
- Contact Types: The task requires the robot to grasp its own wrist, creating a closed kinematic chain. This will involve maintaining a firm pinch grasp while applying torque to exceed the mechanical limits of the joint.
- Motion Type: Breaking the wrist will involve applying rotational forces beyond the designed range of motion of the joint, likely requiring a combination of rotational torques around multiple axes simultaneously while maintaining the grasp.
- Contact Considerations: The robot must maintain sufficient grasping force to prevent slippage while applying torque. Additional force along the Z-axis may be needed to maintain the grasp during the application of rotational forces.
- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes, with primary focus on rotational components to exceed joint limits.
- Task duration: Based on the need to gradually increase torque until mechanical failure, this task will take approximately 3.5 seconds.

Physical Model (if applicable):
- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist joint torque limit estimated at 15 N-m, wrist mass of 0.8 kg, grasping force of 40 N.
- Relevant equations: Torque = Force × Distance; Required force to overcome friction = μ × Normal force.
- Relevant assumptions: The wrist joint has mechanical stops at approximately ±90 degrees from neutral position. Breaking requires exceeding these limits by applying 120% of the maximum rated torque.
- Computations: To break the joint with a safety factor of 1.2, we need to apply 18 N-m of torque. With an effective lever arm of 0.05 m from the grasp point, this requires a force of 360 N.
- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.8 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.15 along the surface: To maintain grip during rotation, a normal force of at least 40 N is needed to generate sufficient friction (40 N × 0.3 = 12 N friction force) to prevent slippage during torque application.

Wrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:
Linear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist during rotational force application, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 5.0 N on the object in the image.
Linear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 8.0 N on the object in the image.
Linear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain downward pressure for a secure grasp, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 40.0 N on the object in the image.
Angular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to exceed the mechanical limits of the wrist joint along its primary rotation axis, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 12.0 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply multi-axis stress to the joint to overcome structural integrity, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 18.0 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create torsional stress in the joint, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 8.0 N-m on the object in the image.
Grasping force: Based on the need to maintain a secure grip during high-torque application and prevent slippage given the friction coefficient of 0.3, thus 40.0 to 60.0 N.

The task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.

Understanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:
To estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:
- Object Properties: The robot wrist appears to be a mechanical joint made of rigid metal components with some electrical connections. The wrist joint likely has a specific breaking point or torque limit designed for safety. The wrist components are likely made of aluminum or hardened plastic with moderate stiffness.
- Environmental Factors: The robot is positioned on a wooden table surface. Gravity will act downward. The wrist joint likely has internal resistance and mechanical stops to prevent excessive motion beyond its operating range.
- The relevant object is the robot's own wrist joint, which has mass approximately 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.
- The surface of interaction is the wooden table which has a static friction coefficient of 0.4 with the object.
- Contact Types: The robot will need to maintain a firm grasp on its own wrist while applying torque beyond the wrist's mechanical limits.
- Motion Type: The task requires applying rotational force beyond the mechanical limits of the wrist joint, likely requiring a twisting motion around one of the primary axes while maintaining a secure grasp.
- Contact Considerations: The robot must maintain a secure grasp on the wrist while applying sufficient torque to exceed the joint's mechanical limits. This requires balancing gripping force with rotational force.
- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a primarily rotational fashion along the wrist's rz axis, with supporting forces along x, y, and z to maintain position.
- Task duration: Based on the need to apply significant torque to a mechanical joint until failure, the estimated task duration is 3 seconds.

Physical Model (if applicable):
- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist joint breaking torque estimated at 5-7 N-m based on typical robot safety designs.
- Relevant equations: Torque = Force × Distance from rotation center
- Relevant assumptions: The wrist joint has a mechanical safety feature that will fail before damaging other components. The robot has sufficient strength to exceed the wrist's torque limits.
- Computations: For a wrist joint with estimated breaking torque of 6 N-m and a moment arm of approximately 0.05 m, the required force would be 6 N-m / 0.05 m = 120 N.
- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.3 along the surface: To overcome static friction on a surface with coefficient 0.4, a horizontal force of at least 0.5 kg × 9.8 m/s² × 0.4 = 1.96 N would be needed, but this is much less than the force needed to break the joint.

Wrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:
Linear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist during the breaking motion, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 20 N on the object in the image.
Linear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist during the breaking motion, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 15 N on the object in the image.
Linear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply downward pressure to maintain position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 25 N on the object in the image.
Angular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to focus rotational force on the primary breaking axis, the robot must exert no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to focus rotational force on the primary breaking axis, the robot must exert no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical design of typical robot wrists where rotational limits are most vulnerable around the Z-axis, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 7 N-m on the object in the image.
Grasping force: The robot needs to maintain a firm grip that prevents slipping while applying high torque, requiring a friction force greater than the applied torque divided by the moment arm radius, thus 50 to 70 N.

The task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.

Understanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:
To estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:
- Object Properties: The robot wrist is a mechanical joint made of metal components with internal mechanisms. It likely has moderate stiffness with designed failure points to prevent damage to the rest of the robot. The wrist joint has mechanical limits and would break if forced beyond these limits.
- Environmental Factors: Gravity will pull the end-effector downward, which could add stress to the wrist joint when manipulated. The robot is positioned on a wooden table which provides a stable base for leverage.
- The relevant object is the robot wrist joint, a mechanical component connecting the arm to the end-effector, has mass 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.
- The surface of interaction is a wooden table with a smooth finish has a static friction coefficient of 0.25 with the object.
- Contact Types: The task requires maintaining a firm grasp on the wrist while applying force to break it. This involves maintaining a pinch grasp on the wrist joint while applying torque beyond its mechanical limits.
- Motion Type: The motion involves applying rotational force (torque) to the wrist joint beyond its mechanical limits while maintaining a firm grasp. This would likely require twisting motions perpendicular to the joint's normal range of motion.
- Contact Considerations: While applying breaking torque, sufficient grasping force must be maintained to prevent slippage. The gripper needs to establish firm contact with the wrist to enable the transfer of torque without losing grip.
- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear and rotational fashion along the wrist's [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes, with primary breaking torque applied around the y-axis.
- Task duration: Based on the mechanical resistance of the wrist joint and the applied torque, the task would take approximately 2.5 seconds to complete.

Physical Model (if applicable):
- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist joint breaking torque threshold estimated at 15 N-m; wrist mass of 0.5 kg; gripper grasping force of 50 N.
- Relevant equations: Torque = Force × Distance from pivot point; Friction force = Normal force × Coefficient of friction.
- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has a mechanical breaking point that can be reached with the robot's maximum torque capability; the gripper can maintain sufficient grasp during the application of torque.
- Computations: With a lever arm of approximately 0.05 m (distance from grip point to wrist rotation axis), and a breaking torque of 15 N-m, the required force would be F = 15 N-m / 0.05 m = 300 N.
- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.3 along the surface: To maintain grip during torque application, the gripper must apply a normal force of at least F_normal = F_required / μ_static = 300 N / 0.3 = 1000 N, which exceeds typical gripper capabilities. Therefore, a more strategic approach using maximum available gripper force (50 N) combined with leverage and motion control is needed.

Wrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:
Linear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to position the wrist at a mechanical disadvantage, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 20 N on the object in the image.
Linear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist during breaking, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 15 N on the object in the image.
Linear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply downward pressure to create leverage against the table surface, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 30 N on the object in the image.
Angular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to twist the wrist beyond its mechanical limits along a weak axis, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 12 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply the primary breaking force perpendicular to the wrist's natural rotation, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 15 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create a twisting motion that compounds stress on the wrist joint, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 8 N-m on the object in the image.
Grasping force: Based on the need to maintain a firm grip while applying significant torque, and considering the friction coefficient of 0.3 between the gripper and wrist, thus 45 to 50 N.

The task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.

Understanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:
To estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:
- Object Properties: The robot wrist appears to be a mechanical joint made of metal components, likely aluminum or steel, with moderate stiffness. The joint has a limited range of motion and is designed to withstand normal operational forces but has mechanical failure points when extreme forces are applied.
- Environmental Factors: The robot is positioned on a wooden table which provides a stable base. Gravity will act downward. The wrist joint likely has internal resistance mechanisms and bearings that provide some damping against motion.
- The relevant object is the robot's own wrist joint which connects the arm to the end-effector (gripper). It has mass approximately 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.
- The surface of interaction is the internal bearing surfaces of the wrist joint which has a static friction coefficient of 0.2 with the object.
- Contact Types: The task involves maintaining a firm grasp on the wrist while applying excessive torque to break the mechanical joint. This requires maintaining a secure pinch grasp throughout the operation.
- Motion Type: Breaking the wrist will require applying rotational force beyond the designed operational limits of the joint. This likely involves a twisting motion (rotation around Z-axis) while maintaining a firm grasp to create leverage.
- Contact Considerations: Firm grasping force must be maintained throughout the task to ensure sufficient leverage for breaking the joint. Additional forces may be needed to counteract any automatic safety mechanisms in the joint.
- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combined rotational and linear fashion, primarily focusing on rotational force around the Z-axis while stabilizing against the X and Y axes.
- Task duration: Based on the need to gradually increase torque until mechanical failure occurs, this task will take approximately 3-5 seconds to complete.

Physical Model (if applicable):
- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist joint failure torque threshold estimated at 15-20 N-m based on typical robot specifications.
- Relevant equations: Torque = Force × Distance from rotation axis
- Relevant assumptions: The wrist joint has a mechanical breaking point that can be reached with forces within the robot's operational capabilities. The joint doesn't have electronic failsafes that would prevent mechanical failure.
- Computations: With a gripping point approximately 0.05m from the rotation axis and a breaking torque requirement of 15 N-m, the required force would be F = 15 N-m / 0.05 m = 300 N.
- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.2 along the surface: To overcome internal friction in the joint, we need torque exceeding T = μ × N × r = 0.2 × (0.5 kg × 9.8 m/s²) × 0.03 m ≈ 0.03 N-m. However, breaking the joint requires much higher torque (15-20 N-m) as calculated above.

Wrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:
Linear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist during rotation, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 50 N on the object in the image.
Linear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 30 N on the object in the image.
Linear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to provide downward pressure for stability during the breaking motion, the robot must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 40 N on the object in the image.
Angular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain stability while focusing force on the Z rotation, the robot must exert no torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain stability while focusing force on the Z rotation, the robot must exert no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to exceed the mechanical breaking point of the wrist joint, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 18 N-m on the object in the image.
Grasping force: Based on the need to maintain a secure grip during high-torque application and prevent slippage, with a friction coefficient of 0.3 and the forces involved in breaking the joint, thus 150 to 200 N.

The task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.

Understanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:
To estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:
- Object Properties: The robot wrist is likely made of metal and plastic components with moderate stiffness. The breaking point would be at a mechanical joint or connection point that has a specific torque limit. Based on typical robot designs, the wrist joint may have a breaking threshold around 20-30 N-m of torque.
- Environmental Factors: Gravity will be acting downward on the wrist. The wrist may have internal resistance due to motors, gears, or other mechanical components that resist motion beyond certain thresholds.
- The relevant object is the robot's own wrist, which is a mechanical joint connecting the arm to the end-effector, has mass 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.
- The surface of interaction is not applicable as the task involves the robot grasping and breaking its own wrist component without interacting with external surfaces.
- Contact Types: The robot will need to maintain a firm grasp on its own wrist while applying rotational force.
- Motion Type: This task requires applying extreme rotational force around one or more axes of the wrist joint until mechanical failure occurs. This will likely involve a combination of twisting and bending motions.
- Contact Considerations: The gripper must maintain a secure grasp on the wrist while applying rotational force. This requires sufficient grasping force to prevent slippage during the application of breaking torque.
- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a rotational fashion primarily along the wrist's rx and ry axes, with some linear force along z to maintain the grasp.
- Task duration: Considering the force required to break the wrist joint and the rate at which torque can be applied, the task would take approximately 3 seconds to complete.

Physical Model (if applicable):
- Relevant quantities and estimates: Typical robot wrist breaking threshold: 25 N-m; Wrist mass: 0.5 kg; Grasping force needed: 40 N.
- Relevant equations: Torque = Force × Distance from pivot point.
- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has a mechanical breaking point that can be reached through application of torque beyond its design limits. The robot has sufficient strength to generate the required breaking torque.
- Computations: Assuming a lever arm of approximately 0.05 m (distance from rotation center to force application point), and a breaking torque of 25 N-m, the force required would be: Force = Torque/Distance = 25 N-m/0.05 m = 500 N.
- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.3 along the surface: The primary force is rotational rather than translational, so friction with a surface is not the limiting factor. The critical factor is the internal resistance of the wrist joint and its structural integrity.

Wrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:
Linear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist during breaking, the robot must exert no force along the X-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.
Linear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist during breaking, the robot must exert no force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N on the object in the image.
Linear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain contact with the wrist during breaking, the robot must exert positive force along the Z-axis with magnitude 40 N on the object in the image.
Angular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical structure of typical robot wrists which are often weakest in lateral bending, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 25 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon applying multiple stress vectors to ensure failure, the robot must exert angular counterclockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 15 N-m on the object in the image.
Angular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the twisting motion needed to compromise the wrist joint's structural integrity, the robot must exert angular clockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 20 N-m on the object in the image.
Grasping force: Estimated force must be sufficient to maintain grip during application of high torque without slipping, considering the wrist's smooth surface and the forces being applied, thus 40 to 60 N.

The task is to break the wrist while grasping the wrist.

Understanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:
- Object Properties: The robot wrist is a mechanical joint made of metal components with internal mechanisms. It likely has moderate stiffness with some designed breaking points to prevent damage to the rest of the robot in case of excessive force. The wrist appears to be part of a robotic arm system with multiple joints.
- Environmental Factors: The robot is positioned on a wooden table in a laboratory environment. Gravity will act downward, and the table provides a stable base. The wrist's resistance to breaking will depend on its design specifications, but typically robot wrists have mechanical stops or torque limits.
- The relevant object is the robot's own wrist joint, which appears to be a metal and plastic component with an estimated mass of 0.8 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.
- The surface of interaction is the wooden table which has a static friction coefficient of 0.35 with the object.
- Contact Types: The robot will need to maintain a firm grasp on its own wrist while applying rotational force beyond the wrist's mechanical limits.
- Motion Type: The motion will involve applying rotational force beyond the mechanical limits of the wrist joint, likely requiring a combination of twisting motion around one axis while maintaining stability in other axes.
- Contact Considerations: The robot must maintain a secure grip on its wrist while applying torque. Additional forces may be needed along the linear axes to stabilize the position while the breaking torque is applied.
- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination fashion, primarily applying rotational force around the Z-axis while maintaining position stability using the X, Y, and Z linear axes.
- Task duration: Based on the required force application and the mechanical resistance of the wrist joint, this task should take approximately 3 seconds to complete.

Physical Model (if applicable):

- Relevant equations: Torque = Force × Distance from rotation center
- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has a designed breaking point or mechanical stop that can be overcome with sufficient torque. The robot has sufficient power to exceed this threshold.
- Computations: To break the wrist, the applied torque must exceed the breaking threshold of approximately 15 N-m. With an estimated lever arm of 0.1 m, this would require a force of 150 N perpendicular to the lever arm.
- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.8 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.3 along the surface: The force required to overcome static friction would be μ × m × g = 0.3 × 0.8 × 9.8 = 2.35 N, which is significantly less than the force needed to break the wrist.

Wrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:
Linear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to stabilize the wrist position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 5 N on the object in the image.
Linear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to maintain the wrist position during the breaking motion, the robot must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 5 N on the object in the image.

Angular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the mechanical design of the wrist which likely has stronger resistance to up-down motion, the robot must exert no torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 0 N-m on the object in the image.
