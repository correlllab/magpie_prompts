      "The provided workspace image confirms a robotic arm with a gripper positioned over a wooden table. The workspace contains computer equipment, a monitor, and a robot arm with its end-effector/gripper visible. The robot appears to be in a laboratory environment.\n",
      "The labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The coordinate system shows X (red), Y (green), and Z (blue) axes centered at what appears to be the robot's wrist joint.\n",
      "The blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward motion in the world, pointing vertically upward from the table surface.\n",
      "Based off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move in a sudden downward (negative Z) direction to create a breaking force at the wrist.\n",
      "The red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to rightward motion in the world, pointing horizontally across the workspace.\n",
      "Based off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move with rapid rotation to create torque that exceeds the structural limits of the wrist.\n",
      "The green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward motion into the workspace (away from the viewer), perpendicular to the X-axis on the horizontal plane.\n",
      "Based off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move with a sudden jerking motion to contribute to the breaking force at the wrist.\n",
      "To accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with a combination of rapid rotational and translational forces that exceed the structural integrity limits of the wrist joint while maintaining a firm grasp on the wrist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding Robot-Applied Forces and Torques to Move Object in the Wrist Frame:\n",
      "To estimate the forces and torques required to accomplish break the wrist while grasping the wrist, we must consider the following:\n",
      "- Object Properties: The robot wrist is likely made of metal (aluminum or steel) with mechanical components, estimated to have moderate stiffness with mechanical failure points at the joint connections. The wrist joint likely has some built-in resistance to prevent damage during normal operation, but has structural limits.\n",
      "- Environmental Factors: Gravity will assist in applying downward force. The robot's control system will likely resist sudden movements as a safety feature, which must be overcome.\n",
      "- The relevant object is the robot wrist joint, which has mass approximately 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.3.\n",
      "- The surface of interaction is the mechanical joint interface which has a static friction coefficient of 0.2 with the object.\n",
      "- Contact Types: The gripper must maintain a firm pinch grasp on the wrist to apply the breaking force effectively.\n",
      "- Motion Type: The breaking motion requires a combination of sudden twisting (rotational) and bending (translational) forces applied simultaneously to exceed the mechanical limits of the joint.\n",
      "- Contact Considerations: Firm grasp must be maintained throughout the motion to effectively transfer the breaking forces to the wrist joint structure.\n",
      "- Motion along axes: The robot exerts motion in a combination of linear and rotational fashion along the wrist's x, y, z, rx, ry, and rz axes, with particular emphasis on rotational forces.\n",
      "- Task duration: The breaking motion should be executed as a rapid impulse taking approximately 0.5 seconds to maximize the force applied and overcome any safety mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical Model (if applicable):\n",
      "- Relevant quantities and estimates: Wrist breaking strength approximately 80-100 N·m for rotational forces, 200-300 N for linear forces.\n",
      "- Relevant equations: F = ma for linear acceleration; τ = Iα for rotational acceleration; Impulse = F·Δt.\n",
      "- Relevant assumptions: The wrist has mechanical failure points at the joint connections; rapid application of force will be more effective than gradual application.\n",
      "- Computations: For a 0.5 kg wrist component with rapid acceleration of 20 m/s², F = 0.5 kg × 20 m/s² = 10 N. For rotational breaking, assuming moment of inertia I ≈ 0.01 kg·m² and angular acceleration α ≈ 100 rad/s², τ = 0.01 × 100 = 1 N·m. However, to break the wrist, we need to exceed design limits by applying approximately 10× these forces.\n",
      "- Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.5 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.2 along the surface: To overcome static friction, a minimum force of F = μN = 0.2 × (0.5 kg × 9.8 m/s²) ≈ 1 N is needed. To break the wrist, forces exceeding 100 N and torques exceeding 80 N·m will be applied in a sudden impulse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation:\n",
      "Linear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create a sudden shearing force at the wrist joint, the object in the image must exert positive force along the X-axis with magnitude 150 N.\n",
      "Linear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create a bending moment at the wrist, the object in the image must exert positive force along the Y-axis with magnitude 120 N.\n",
      "Linear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to apply downward force to assist in the breaking motion, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 200 N.\n",
      "Angular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create a twisting motion that exceeds the rotational limits of the wrist, the object in the image must exert counterclockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 90 N-m.\n",
      "Angular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create a bending moment perpendicular to the X-axis rotation, the object in the image must exert clockwise torque about the Y-axis with magnitude 85 N-m.\n",
      "Angular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to create torsional stress at the wrist joint, the object in the image must exert counterclockwise torque about the Z-axis with magnitude 70 N-m.\n",
      "Grasping force: A firm grip is essential to transfer the breaking forces effectively without the gripper slipping, requiring approximately 100 to 150 N.\n",
